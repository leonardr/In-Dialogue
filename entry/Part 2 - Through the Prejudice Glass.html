CHAPTER I. Looking-Glass house</p>
<p>One thing was certain, that the WHITE kitten had had nothing to do with
it:--it was the black kitten's fault entirely. For the white kitten had
been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of
an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it
COULDN'T have had any hand in the mischief.</p>
<p>The way Dinah washed her children's faces was this: first she held the
poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she
rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and
just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was
lying quite still and trying to purr--no doubt feeling that it was all
meant for its good.</p>
<p>But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon,
and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great
arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been
having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been
trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all
come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all
knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the
middle.</p>
<p>"Oh! my dear Lydia," cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and
giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace.
"when shall we meet again?" she added, looking reproachfully at the old
cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage--and then she
scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted
with her, and began winding up the ball again. But she didn't get on
very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and
sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to
watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one
paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it
might.</p>
<p>"Oh! yes," Alice began. "Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him." Here Alice wound two or three turns of the
worsted round the kitten's neck, just to see how it would look: this led
to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards
and yards of it got unwound again.</p>
<p>"Is this," Alice went on as soon as they were
comfortably settled again, "meant for me?" she
went on, holding up one finger. "And pray, what
is the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds." (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) 'Her paw went into your
eye? Well, that's YOUR fault, for keeping your eyes open--if you'd
shut them tight up, it wouldn't have happened. Now don't make any more
excuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail
just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her! What, you were
thirsty, were you? How do you know she wasn't thirsty too? Now for
number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasn't
looking!</p>
<p>"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he
is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to
be in the house by the end of next week." she went on,
talking more to herself than the kitten. 'What WOULD they do at the end
of a year? I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came.
Or--let me see--suppose each punishment was to be going without a
dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without
fifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldn't mind THAT much! I'd far rather
go without them than eat them!</p>
<p>"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first." cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap
her hands. 'And I do so WISH it was true! I'm sure the woods look sleepy
in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown.</p>
<p>"Indeed!" And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice
used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase "And
pray, may I ask?--" She
had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before--all
because Alice had begun with "Is
it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility
to his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope," and
her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn't,
because there were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at last
to say, "that he is improved in essentials."
And once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in
her ear, "I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way."</p>
<p>But this is taking us away from Alice's speech to the kitten. "You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers." And Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it
up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing
didn't succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldn't
fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held it up to the
Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was--"Very well, if it must be so, it must." she added, "There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of
course familiar with: 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge'; and I
shall keep mine to swell my song."</p>
<p>'Now, if you'll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, I'll tell you
all my ideas about Looking-glass House. First, there's the room you can
see through the glass--that's just the same as our drawing room, only
the things go the other way. I can see all of it when I get upon a
chair--all but the bit behind the fireplace. Oh! I do so wish I could
see THAT bit! I want so much to know whether they've a fire in the
winter: you never CAN tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and then
smoke comes up in that room too--but that may be only pretence, just to
make it look as if they had a fire. Well then, the books are something
like our books, only the words go the wrong way; I know that, because
I've held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in
the other room.</p>
<p>"Yours, etc." She was up on the chimney-piece while she
said this, though she hardly knew how she had got there. And certainly
the glass WAS beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist.</p>
<p>In another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly
down into the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was
to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite
pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as
the one she had left behind. "Now I have got some news for you," thought Alice: "What do you think? It is excellent news--capital news--and about
a certain person we all like!"</p>
<p>Then she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from
the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest
was as different as possible. For instance, the pictures on the
wall next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on
the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the
Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her.</p>
<p>"Well girls," Alice thought to
herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among
the cinders: but in another moment, with a little "What
say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so
fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
Lucases' last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French
cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And
what do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her
at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously." of surprise, she
was down on her hands and knees watching them. The chessmen were walking
about, two and two!</p>
<p>"And we mean to treat you all," Alice said (in a whisper, for
fear of frightening them), "but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." she went on, as she
put her head closer down, "Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think
it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall
pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
better."</p>
<p>Here something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her
turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and
begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would
happen next.</p>
<p>"I do not know when I have been more shocked," the White Queen cried out as she rushed
past the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders.
"Wickham so
very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing
of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it
so." and she began scrambling wildly
up the side of the fender.</p>
<p>"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not
hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.
Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been
to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the
matter with me.--Yours, etc." said the King, rubbing his nose, which had been
hurt by the fall. He had a right to be a LITTLE annoyed with the Queen,
for he was covered with ashes from head to foot.</p>
<p>Alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was
nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen and
set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter.</p>
<p>The Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had
quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing
but hug the little Lily in silence. As soon as she had recovered her
breath a little, she called out to the White King, who was sitting
sulkily among the ashes, "You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They
are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration
these last twenty years at least."</p>
<p>"There were some very strong objections against the lady," said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if
he thought that was the most likely place to find one.</p>
<p>"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath.
"and
I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well."</p>
<p>Alice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar,
till at last she said, "That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer." But the King
took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither
hear her nor see her.</p>
<p>So Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly
than she had lifted the Queen, that she mightn't take his breath away:
but, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well dust
him a little, he was so covered with ashes.</p>
<p>She said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face
as the King made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible
hand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but
his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder
and rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let
him drop upon the floor.</p>
<p>"How despicably I have acted!" she cried out, quite
forgetting that the King couldn't hear her. "I, who have prided myself
on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified
my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this
discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could
not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my
folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself." she
added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the
Queen.</p>
<p>The King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and
Alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room
to see if she could find any water to throw over him. However, she could
find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she
found he had recovered, and he and the Queen were talking together in a
frightened whisper--so low, that Alice could hardly hear what they said.</p>
<p>The King was saying, "Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.
Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn
on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And
Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters', if
they should be of use to us."</p>
<p>To which the Queen replied, "But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to
discover it too."</p>
<p>"Indeed, Mr. Bennet," the King went on, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!"</p>
<p>"A gamester!" the Queen said, "This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it."</p>
<p>Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous
memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought
struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some
way over his shoulder, and began writing for him.</p>
<p>The poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil
for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him,
and at last he panted out, "Not one."</p>
<p>"My dear madam," said the Queen, looking over the book (in which
Alice had put "let us be for ever silent on this point.
Far be it from me,") "to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation
to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a
young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment;
and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt
of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;
for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as
when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our
estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect
to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to
your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my
behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my
dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all
liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."</p>
<p>There was a book lying near Alice on the table, and while she sat
watching the White King (for she was still a little anxious about him,
and had the ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted again),
she turned over the leaves, to find some part that she could read,
"True. You _are_ a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother?
Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition." she said to herself.</p>
<p>It was like this.</p>
<p><br/>
             YKCOWREBBAJ</p>
<p>     sevot yhtils eht dna,gillirb sawT'<br/>
      ebaw eht ni elbmig dna eryg diD<br/>
        ,sevogorob eht erew ysmim llA<br/>
       .ebargtuo shtar emom eht dnA</p>
<p>
She puzzled over this for some time, but at last a bright thought struck
her. "I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he
is a great friend of Darcy's."</p>
<p>This was the poem that Alice read.</p>
<p><br/>
             JABBERWOCKY</p>
<p>     'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br/>
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br/>
     All mimsy were the borogoves,<br/>
      And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
<p>     "Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners
as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of
_retaining_ them, is less certain."</p>
<p>     He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br/>
      Long time the manxome foe he sought--<br/>
     So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br/>
      And stood awhile in thought.</p>
<p>     And as in uffish thought he stood,<br/>
      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br/>
     Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br/>
      And burbled as it came!</p>
<p>     One, two! One, two! And through and through<br/>
      The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br/>
     He left it dead, and with its head<br/>
      He went galumphing back.</p>
<p>     "He brought it with him for us to see."<br/>
      He chortled in his joy.</p>
<p>     'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br/>
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br/>
     All mimsy were the borogoves,<br/>
      And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
<p>
"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet," she said when she had finished it, "what are you
talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely
more." (You see she didn't like to confess, even
to herself, that she couldn't make it out at all.) "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so
happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it
would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!"</p>
<p>"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match," thought Alice, suddenly jumping up, "I should never have said Mrs. Collins
was settled _near_ her family."
She was out of the room in a moment, and ran down stairs--or, at least,
it wasn't exactly running, but a new invention of hers for getting down
stairs quickly and easily, as Alice said to herself. She just kept the
tips of her fingers on the hand-rail, and floated gently down without
even touching the stairs with her feet; then she floated on through the
hall, and would have gone straight out at the door in the same way, if
she hadn't caught hold of the door-post. She was getting a little giddy
with so much floating in the air, and was rather glad to find herself
walking again in the natural way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
CHAPTER II. The Garden of Live Flowers</p>
<p>"Come here, child," said Alice to herself, "I have sent for
you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made
you an offer of marriage. Is it true?" (after going a few yards along
the path, and turning several sharp corners), "Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"</p>
<p>And so she did: wandering up and down, and trying turn after turn, but
always coming back to the house, do what she would. Indeed, once, when
she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual, she ran against it
before she could stop herself.</p>
<p>"I assure
you, I feel it exceedingly," Alice said, looking up at the house and
pretending it was arguing with her. "I believe no one
feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly
attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to
me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The
dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His
attachment to Rosings certainly increases."</p>
<p>So, resolutely turning her back upon the house, she set out once more
down the path, determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill.
For a few minutes all went on well, and she was just saying, "La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were
married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in
that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in
such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to
put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was
my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as
if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in
ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed
to know whether he would be married in his blue coat." when the path gave a sudden twist and shook
itself (as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she found
herself actually walking in at the door.</p>
<p>"I can readily believe," she cried. "that reports may vary
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."</p>
<p>However, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to be
done but start again. This time she came upon a large flower-bed, with a
border of daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle.</p>
<p>"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said Alice, addressing herself to one that was waving
gracefully about in the wind, "that is rather singular."</p>
<p>"Yes, always," said the Tiger-lily: "I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
created_."</p>
<p>Alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite
seemed to take her breath away. At length, as the Tiger-lily only went
on waving about, she spoke again, in a timid voice--almost in a whisper.
"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them."</p>
<p>"I comfort myself with thinking," said the Tiger-lily. "that he certainly would
not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children
of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand
pounds?"</p>
<p>"By all means," said the Rose, "let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not
know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,
when he has nothing to do."</p>
<p>"Upon my word," the Tiger-lily remarked. "you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?"</p>
<p>Alice didn't like being criticised, so she began asking questions.
"Nor I, I am sure,"</p>
<p>"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said the Rose: "did he come at all?"</p>
<p>"My style of writing is very different from yours." Alice asked.</p>
<p>"Did it," cried a Daisy: "did it soon make you
think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?"</p>
<p>"for your housekeeper," cried another Daisy, and here they all began
shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little shrill
voices. "informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected
in the country." cried the Tiger-lily, waving itself
passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement. "They
will join me early to-morrow," it panted, bending its quivering head towards
Alice, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters."</p>
<p>"I wonder," Alice said in a soothing tone, and stooping down to the
daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered, "whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer."</p>
<p>There was silence in a moment, and several of the pink daisies turned
white.</p>
<p>"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong," said the Tiger-lily. "and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment!"</p>
<p>"Whatever my connections may be," Alice said, hoping to get it
into a better temper by a compliment. "if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."</p>
<p>"was a very long time since
he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" said the Tiger-lily. "It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of
November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield."</p>
<p>Alice did so. "I do not blame Jane," she said, "for Jane would have got Mr.
Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think
that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had it not
been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just
as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves."</p>
<p>"All this she must possess," the Tiger-lily said, "and to all this she must
yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading."</p>
<p>This sounded a very good reason, and Alice was quite pleased to know it.
"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a
most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be
assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,
from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland
with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our
surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am
very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing
to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step
(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is
disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.
Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How
thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against
him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about
twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have
passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect
him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of
their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor
mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly
know what I have written." she said.</p>
<p>"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood." the Rose said in a rather
severe tone.</p>
<p>"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good
deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on
their way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You
shall hear what she says." a Violet said, so suddenly,
that Alice quite jumped; for it hadn't spoken before.</p>
<p>"It is amazing to me," cried the Tiger-lily. "how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished as they all are."</p>
<p>"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _they_ will
take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed
for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often
talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as
quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens." Alice said, not
choosing to notice the Rose's last remark.</p>
<p>"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in
your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your
understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide
difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,
and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that
I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with
the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of
behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to
follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to
perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to
profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant
guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by
education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young
lady like yourself."
said the Rose. "apology," (" and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh."
said the Tiger-lily), "I did not know that you intended to walk,"</p>
<p>"I would not be so fastidious as you are," Alice asked eagerly, for the thought crossed her mind,
"for a
kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in
my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty."</p>
<p>"Not yet," the Rose said, "But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
everything will be well."</p>
<p>"Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?" the Tiger-lily
interrupted: "How can you be smiling so,
Lizzy?"</p>
<p>"You are too hasty, sir," the Rose added kindly: "You forget that I have made no
answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to
decline them."</p>
<p>Alice didn't like this idea at all: so, to change the subject, she asked
"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their
marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular
friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He
cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what
restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has
no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter."</p>
<p>"He meant I believe," said the Rose. "to go to Epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could
be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come
with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might
be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any
other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this."</p>
<p>"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due." Alice asked with some curiosity.</p>
<p>"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," the Rose replied. "I am trying to make it out."</p>
<p>"And is this all?" cried the Larkspur. "I expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
daughter."</p>
<p>Alice looked round eagerly, and found that it was the Red Queen. "Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor." was her first remark. She had indeed: when Alice
first found her in the ashes, she had been only three inches high--and
here she was, half a head taller than Alice herself!</p>
<p>"Oh!" said the Rose: "I heard you before, but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare."</p>
<p>"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond
of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas." said Alice, for, though the flowers were
interesting enough, she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk
with a real Queen.</p>
<p>"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you," said the Rose: "that a ball
of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,
can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing
myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of
soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,
a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her."</p>
<p>This sounded nonsense to Alice, so she said nothing, but set off at
once towards the Red Queen. To her surprise, she lost sight of her in a
moment, and found herself walking in at the front-door again.</p>
<p>A little provoked, she drew back, and after looking everywhere for the
queen (whom she spied out at last, a long way off), she thought she
would try the plan, this time, of walking in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>It succeeded beautifully. She had not been walking a minute before she
found herself face to face with the Red Queen, and full in sight of the
hill she had been so long aiming at.</p>
<p>"We will be down as soon as we can," said the Red Queen. "but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."</p>
<p>Alice attended to all these directions, and explained, as well as she
could, that she had lost her way.</p>
<p>"And of this place," said the Queen: "I might have been mistress! With
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of
viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no," she
added in a kinder tone. "that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to
me; I should not have been allowed to invite them."</p>
<p>Alice wondered a little at this, but she was too much in awe of the
Queen to disbelieve it. "She is so fond of Mrs. Forster," she thought to
herself, "it will be quite shocking
to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s
regiment."</p>
<p>"As much as I ever wish to be," the Queen said, looking at her watch:
"I have
spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable."</p>
<p>"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not
conceal your age."</p>
<p>"I hope," said the Queen, patting her on the head, which Alice
didn't like at all, "that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her."</p>
<p>Alice didn't dare to argue the point, but went on: "A great many indeed,"</p>
<p>"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," the Queen interrupted, "and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy
together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You
mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat
you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than
it does."</p>
<p>"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," said Alice, surprised into contradicting her at last:
"let us return to Mr.
Bingley."</p>
<p>The Red Queen shook her head, "If he were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,"
she said, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has
not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never
be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is
actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!"</p>
<p>Alice curtseyed again, as she was afraid from the Queen's tone that she
was a LITTLE offended: and they walked on in silence till they got to
the top of the little hill.</p>
<p>For some minutes Alice stood without speaking, looking out in all
directions over the country--and a most curious country it was. There
were a number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side
to side, and the ground between was divided up into squares by a number
of little green hedges, that reached from brook to brook.</p>
<p>"To
treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his
father!" Alice said at
last. "A young man, too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable" She added in a tone of delight, and her heart began to beat quick
with excitement as she went on. "and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,
connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!"</p>
<p>She glanced rather shyly at the real Queen as she said this, but her
companion only smiled pleasantly, and said, "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?" Just at this moment, somehow or
other, they began to run.</p>
<p>Alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it
was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand
in hand, and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep
up with her: and still the Queen kept crying "From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of
my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of
the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of
disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the
last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry." but Alice
felt she COULD NOT go faster, though she had not breath left to say so.</p>
<p>The most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other
things round them never changed their places at all: however fast they
went, they never seemed to pass anything. "But it is fortunate," thought poor puzzled Alice. And the Queen seemed to
guess her thoughts, for she cried, "that I have something to wish for.
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation."</p>
<p>Not that Alice had any idea of doing THAT. She felt as if she would
never be able to talk again, she was getting so much out of breath: and
still the Queen cried "Is it possible?" and dragged her along. "Can it be
possible that he will marry her?" Alice managed to pant out at last.</p>
<p>"No, I thank you," the Queen repeated. "There
is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by
some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn." And they ran on for a time in silence, with the wind whistling
in Alice's ears, and almost blowing her hair off her head, she fancied.</p>
<p>"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley," cried the Queen. "I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.
Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you." And they went so fast
that at last they seemed to skim through the air, hardly touching the
ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as Alice was getting quite
exhausted, they stopped, and she found herself sitting on the ground,
breathless and giddy.</p>
<p>The Queen propped her up against a tree, and said kindly, "Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?"</p>
<p>Alice looked round her in great surprise. "Blame you! Oh, no."</p>
<p>"If you _will_ thank me," said the Queen, "let it be for yourself alone.
That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your
_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought
only of _you_."</p>
<p>"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Alice, still panting a little, "who can it be?"</p>
<p>"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said the Queen. "has
too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I
cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished."</p>
<p>"What does Mr. Darcy mean," said Alice. "by listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster?"</p>
<p>"You are very cruel," the Queen said good-naturedly, taking a little
box out of her pocket. "you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment."</p>
<p>Alice thought it would not be civil to say "Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can." though it wasn't at all
what she wanted. So she took it, and ate it as well as she could: and it
was VERY dry; and she thought she had never been so nearly choked in all
her life.</p>
<p>"To be sure, Lizzy," said the Queen, "he is not so handsome as Wickham;
or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features
are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so
disagreeable?" And she took a ribbon out of her pocket, marked in
inches, and began measuring the ground, and sticking little pegs in here
and there.</p>
<p>"Well," she said, putting in a peg to mark the
distance, "have it as you choose. _He_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."</p>
<p>"How strange!" said Alice: "How abominable! I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for
dishonesty I must call it."</p>
<p>"Is your sister at Pemberley still?" said the Queen.</p>
<p>Alice did not know what to say to this, but luckily the Queen did not
wait for an answer, but went on. "Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
long in one attitude."</p>
<p>She had got all the pegs put in by this time, and Alice looked on
with great interest as she returned to the tree, and then began slowly
walking down the row.</p>
<p>At the two-yard peg she faced round, and said, "The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence."</p>
<p>"She will drop the acquaintance entirely." Alice faltered out.</p>
<p>"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever looked into." Alice got up and curtseyed, and sat down again.</p>
<p>At the next peg the Queen turned again, and this time she said, "Sir, you quite misunderstand me," She did not wait for Alice
to curtsey this time, but walked on quickly to the next peg, where she
turned for a moment to say "Lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as
good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure." and then hurried on to the last.</p>
<p>How it happened, Alice never knew, but exactly as she came to the last
peg, she was gone. Whether she vanished into the air, or whether she
ran quickly into the wood ("He is certainly a good brother," thought Alice),
there was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and Alice began to
remember that she was a Pawn, and that it would soon be time for her to
move.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
CHAPTER III. Looking-Glass Insects</p>
<p>Of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the
country she was going to travel through. "And this," thought Alice, as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of
being able to see a little further. "is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!
I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,"
and for some time she stood silent, watching one of them that was
bustling about among the flowers, poking its proboscis into them, "these offenses might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater
policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of
my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and
just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?" thought Alice.</p>
<p>However, this was anything but a regular bee: in fact it was an
elephant--as Alice soon found out, though the idea quite took her breath
away at first. "My dear Mr. Bennet," was her next
idea. "how can you be so tiresome! You
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them." she went on, checking herself just as
she was beginning to run down the hill, and trying to find some excuse
for turning shy so suddenly. "How hard it is in some cases to be believed!" (here came the favourite little toss of the head), "And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"</p>
<p>"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," she said after a pause: "have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either
would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn."</p>
<p>So with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the first of
the six little brooks.</p>
<p>  *    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>  *    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?" said the Guard, putting his head in at the window.
In a moment everybody was holding out a ticket: they were about the same
size as the people, and quite seemed to fill the carriage.</p>
<p>"If I had been able," the Guard went on, looking angrily
at Alice. And a great many voices all said together ("to carry my point in going to Brighton,
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia
had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been
well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the
charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!
And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,
wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become
of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his
grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we
shall do." thought Alice), "You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for
believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is
unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections
with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further
consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo
the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,
I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."</p>
<p>"My dear Mr. Bennet," Alice said in a frightened tone: "have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?" And again the chorus of
voices went on. "Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."</p>
<p>"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said the Guard: "and
nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself." And once more the chorus of voices went on with "No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."</p>
<p>Alice thought to herself, "I am astonished," The
voices didn't join in this time, as she hadn't spoken, but to her
great surprise, they all THOUGHT in chorus (I hope you understand what
THINKING IN CHORUS means--for I must confess that _I_ don't), "that my father should have left
so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!"</p>
<p>"Go to your father, he
wants you in the library." thought
Alice.</p>
<p>All this time the Guard was looking at her, first through a telescope,
then through a microscope, and then through an opera-glass. At last he
said, "Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!" and shut up the window and went
away.</p>
<p>"That is the most unforgiving speech," said the gentleman sitting opposite to her (he was
dressed in white paper), "that I ever
heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."</p>
<p>A Goat, that was sitting next to the gentleman in white, shut his
eyes and said in a loud voice, "_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne
for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into
my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be
absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.
And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have
spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner."</p>
<p>There was a Beetle sitting next to the Goat (it was a very queer
carriage-full of passengers altogether), and, as the rule seemed to be
that they should all speak in turn, HE went on with "But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?"</p>
<p>Alice couldn't see who was sitting beyond the Beetle, but a hoarse voice
spoke next. "No, I believe not." it said, and was obliged to leave off.</p>
<p>"I did not know before," Alice thought to herself. And an extremely
small voice, close to her ear, said, "that you were a
studier of character. It must be an amusing study."</p>
<p>Then a very gentle voice in the distance said, "I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the
old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
me. But of course she did not mention my name to you."</p>
<p>And after that other voices went on ("Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your
sake," thought Alice), saying, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought
necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, Miss
Bennet?" 'She must be sent as a message by the telegraph--"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a
conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as
I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him
cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though
it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,
change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade
yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of
danger security for happiness." and so on.</p>
<p>But the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and whispered
in her ear, "May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and
Mrs. Collins well."</p>
<p>"I know very well, madam," Alice said rather impatiently. "that when persons sit down to a
card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters."</p>
<p>"But I can assure you," said the little voice close to her ear:
"that Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man."</p>
<p>"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," said Alice, looking about in vain to see where the
voice came from; "it
would not make them one jot less agreeable."</p>
<p>The little voice sighed deeply: it was VERY unhappy, evidently, and
Alice would have said something pitying to comfort it, "And what did she say?" she thought. But this was such a wonderfully
small sigh, that she wouldn't have heard it at all, if it hadn't come
QUITE close to her ear. The consequence of this was that it tickled her
ear very much, and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of
the poor little creature.</p>
<p>"Your friend performs delightfully," the little voice went on; "and I doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy."</p>
<p>"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's
journey. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance." Alice inquired a little anxiously. What she
really wanted to know was, whether it could sting or not, but she
thought this wouldn't be quite a civil question to ask.</p>
<p>"This must be false!
This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!" the little voice began, when it was drowned by
a shrill scream from the engine, and everybody jumped up in alarm, Alice
among the rest.</p>
<p>The Horse, who had put his head out of the window, quietly drew it in
and said, "Thank you," Everybody seemed
satisfied with this, though Alice felt a little nervous at the idea of
trains jumping at all. "for if you did, I should certainly tell you
all, and then Wickham would be angry." she said to herself. In another moment she felt
the carriage rise straight up into the air, and in her fright she caught
at the thing nearest to her hand, which happened to be the Goat's beard.</p>
<p>  *    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>  *    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>But the beard seemed to melt away as she touched it, and she found
herself sitting quietly under a tree--while the Gnat (for that was the
insect she had been talking to) was balancing itself on a twig just over
her head, and fanning her with its wings.</p>
<p>It certainly was a VERY large Gnat: "He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.
Darcy is." Alice
thought. Still, she couldn't feel nervous with it, after they had been
talking together so long.</p>
<p>"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of
use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the
Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence,
and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself." the Gnat went on, as quietly as if
nothing had happened.</p>
<p>"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" Alice said. "I am all astonishment.
How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you
joy?"</p>
<p>"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,
and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get
a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary." the Gnat
inquired.</p>
<p>"Indeed I have, sir," Alice explained, "She is a great deal too ill to be
moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass
a little longer on your kindness."</p>
<p>"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to
come to Hunsford." the Gnat remarked carelessly.</p>
<p>"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,
ever induce me to be explicit."</p>
<p>"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," the Gnat said, "It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single."</p>
<p>"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said Alice; "If he wants our society,
let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours
in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
again."</p>
<p>"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?" the Gnat replied. "Sure he
will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?"</p>
<p>"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is
come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss
Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss
Lizzy's hair." Alice began, counting off the names on
her fingers.</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed," said the Gnat: "I assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town."</p>
<p>"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this
it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with." Alice asked, with great curiosity.</p>
<p>"But what is to be done about Pemberley?" said the Gnat. "John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for
us; was it so?"</p>
<p>Alice looked up at the Rocking-horse-fly with great interest, and made
up her mind that it must have been just repainted, it looked so bright
and sticky; and then she went on.</p>
<p>"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away
Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me
so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town."</p>
<p>"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said the Gnat, "and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle
directly."</p>
<p>"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."</p>
<p>"He is just what a young man ought to be," the Gnat replied; "sensible,
good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much
ease, with such perfect good breeding!"</p>
<p>"Elizabeth Bennet," Alice went on, after she had taken
a good look at the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to
herself, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the
other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."</p>
<p>"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," said the Gnat (Alice drew her feet back in
some alarm), "but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town
next Saturday."</p>
<p>"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me."</p>
<p>"Mr. Darcy!"</p>
<p>A new difficulty came into Alice's head. "But not before they went to Brighton?" she suggested.</p>
<p>"I can guess the subject of your reverie."</p>
<p>"It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,
as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
can never be what we once were to each other." Alice remarked thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of
their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?" said the Gnat.</p>
<p>After this, Alice was silent for a minute or two, pondering. The Gnat
amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head: at last
it settled again and remarked, "Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is
a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
comes here to-morrow with him."</p>
<p>"And have you answered the letter?" Alice said, a little anxiously.</p>
<p>"But it is not merely this affair," the Gnat went on in a careless tone: "on which my dislike
is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was
decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to
say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?"</p>
<p>"That is very true," said Alice: "though it had not occurred to me
before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!
it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this."</p>
<p>"I do indeed," the Gnat
remarked, "I told you, the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other
circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From
what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her."</p>
<p>"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
friend within a few days," Alice asked. "I shall know how to understand
it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his
constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all."</p>
<p>But the Gnat only sighed deeply, while two large tears came rolling down
its cheeks.</p>
<p>"Oh! my dear father," Alice said, "come back and write immediately.
Consider how important every moment is in such a case."</p>
<p>Then came another of those melancholy little sighs, and this time the
poor Gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away, for, when Alice
looked up, there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig, and, as
she was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long, she got up and
walked on.</p>
<p>She very soon came to an open field, with a wood on the other side of
it: it looked much darker than the last wood, and Alice felt a LITTLE
timid about going into it. However, on second thoughts, she made up her
mind to go on: "That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," she thought to herself,
and this was the only way to the Eighth Square.</p>
<p>"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard
so much?" she said thoughtfully to herself, "a place, too, with which so many of your
acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you
know." HAD ON A BRASS COLLAR"--just fancy
calling everything you met "Alice," till one of them answered! Only they
wouldn't answer at all, if they were wise.'</p>
<p>She was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood: it looked
very cool and shady. "I know not, Miss Elizabeth," she
said as she stepped under the trees, "whether Mrs. Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We
know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain
manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly." she went on, rather surprised at not being able to
think of the word. "I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and
could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,
when we are better acquainted--" putting her hand on the trunk of the tree. "She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her."</p>
<p>She stood silent for a minute, thinking: then she suddenly began again.
"How can you talk so?" But being determined
didn't help much, and all she could say, after a great deal of puzzling,
was, "You must know that
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate."</p>
<p>Just then a Fawn came wandering by: it looked at Alice with its large
gentle eyes, but didn't seem at all frightened. "I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."
Alice said, as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it; but it only
started back a little, and then stood looking at her again.</p>
<p>"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!" the Fawn said at last. Such a soft sweet
voice it had!</p>
<p>"Did you speak from your own observation," thought poor Alice. She answered, rather sadly,
"when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"</p>
<p>"How nicely we are all crammed in," it said: "I am glad I bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all
since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any
flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.
She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not
being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to
get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so
she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a
lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,
and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.
Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."</p>
<p>Alice thought, but nothing came of it. "Oh, my dear,
dear aunt," she said timidly. "what delight! what felicity! You
give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What
are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport
we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other
travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We
_will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.
Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our
imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,
will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let _our_
first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of
travellers."</p>
<p>"Haye Park might do," the Fawn said. "if the Gouldings could quit it--or the
great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."</p>
<p>So they walked on together though the wood, Alice with her arms clasped
lovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn, till they came out into
another open field, and here the Fawn gave a sudden bound into the air,
and shook itself free from Alice's arms. "Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," it cried out in a
voice of delight, "I should like to know how he behaves among strangers." A sudden look of
alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes, and in another moment it had
darted away at full speed.</p>
<p>Alice stood looking after it, almost ready to cry with vexation at
having lost her dear little fellow-traveller so suddenly. "I knew," she said, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part
especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the
power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me."</p>
<p>It was not a very difficult question to answer, as there was only one
road through the wood, and the two finger-posts both pointed along it.
"What will be his surprise," Alice said to herself, "when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of
fashion."</p>
<p>But this did not seem likely to happen. She went on and on, a long way,
but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger-posts
pointing the same way, one marked "I like her appearance," and the other
"She
looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will
make him a very proper wife."</p>
<p>"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him," said Alice at last, "My dear father, I congratulate you." So she
wandered on, talking to herself as she went, till, on turning a sharp
corner, she came upon two fat little men, so suddenly that she could not
help starting back, but in another moment she recovered herself, feeling
sure that they must be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
CHAPTER IV. Tweedledum And Tweedledee</p>
<p>They were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the other's
neck, and Alice knew which was which in a moment, because one of them
had "I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," embroidered on his collar, and the other "It
would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she
says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!" 'I suppose
they've each got "TWEEDLE" round at the back of the collar,' she said to
herself.</p>
<p>They stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive, and she was
just looking round to see if the word "TWEEDLE" was written at the back
of each collar, when she was startled by a voice coming from the one
marked "It is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to
think."</p>
<p>"Though it is difficult," he said, "to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit."</p>
<p>"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," added the one marked "My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you
certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?" 'if you think we're alive,
you ought to speak.'</p>
<p>"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe
me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was
rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so
just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon
business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once
they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I
did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we
were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he
came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However,
I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well." was all Alice could say; for the words of the
old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of a clock, and
she could hardly help saying them out loud:--</p>
<p><br/>
     'Tweedledum and Tweedledee<br/>
      Agreed to have a battle;<br/>
     For Tweedledum said Tweedledee<br/>
      Had spoiled his nice new rattle.</p>
<p>     Just then flew down a monstrous crow,<br/>
      As black as a tar-barrel;<br/>
     Which frightened both the heroes so,<br/>
      They quite forgot their quarrel.'</p>
<p>"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Tweedledum: "We
can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate
as you are, you must know how it is to be done."</p>
<p>"It has been a very agreeable day," continued Tweedledee, "The
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we
may often meet again."</p>
<p>"His misfortunes!" Alice said very politely, "yes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed."</p>
<p>But the little men only looked at each other and grinned.</p>
<p>They looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys, that Alice
couldn't help pointing her finger at Tweedledum, and saying "Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There
is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I
ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand
Wickham's character."</p>
<p>"When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance." Tweedledum cried out briskly, and shut his mouth up again with
a snap.</p>
<p>"An excellent consolation in its way," said Alice, passing on to Tweedledee, though she felt quite
certain he would only shout out "but it will not
do for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often
happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before." and so he did.</p>
<p>"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," cried Tweedledum. "I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to
marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten." And here the two brothers gave each
other a hug, and then they held out the two hands that were free, to
shake hands with her.</p>
<p>Alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first, for fear
of hurting the other one's feelings; so, as the best way out of the
difficulty, she took hold of both hands at once: the next moment they
were dancing round in a ring. This seemed quite natural (she remembered
afterwards), and she was not even surprised to hear music playing: it
seemed to come from the tree under which they were dancing, and it was
done (as well as she could make it out) by the branches rubbing one
across the other, like fiddles and fiddle-sticks.</p>
<p>"You judge very properly," (Alice said afterwards, when she was
telling her sister the history of all this,) "and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?"</p>
<p>The other two dancers were fat, and very soon out of breath. "Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold
your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation
together." Tweedledum panted out, and they left
off dancing as suddenly as they had begun: the music stopped at the same
moment.</p>
<p>Then they let go of Alice's hands, and stood looking at her for a
minute: there was a rather awkward pause, as Alice didn't know how to
begin a conversation with people she had just been dancing with. "But it is," she said to herself: "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it."</p>
<p>"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt
a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him
in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter
she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their
being in love with each other, many weeks." she said at last.</p>
<p>"Nearly three weeks." said Tweedledum.</p>
<p>"That is very true," added Tweedledee. "and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."</p>
<p>"But," Alice said doubtfully. "you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here."</p>
<p>"he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in
a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to
approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs." said Tweedledee, looking round at
Tweedledum with great solemn eyes, and not noticing Alice's question.</p>
<p>"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months." Tweedledum replied,
giving his brother an affectionate hug.</p>
<p>Tweedledee began instantly:</p>
<p>       "I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may
ask questions which I shall not choose to answer."</p>
<p>Here Alice ventured to interrupt him. "Now I am quite happy," she said, as
politely as she could, "for you will be as happy as myself.
I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you,
I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your
husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you
tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know
of it to another, not to you."</p>
<p>Tweedledee smiled gently, and began again:</p>
<p>     'The sun was shining on the sea,<br/>
      Shining with all his might:<br/>
     He did his very best to make<br/>
      The billows smooth and bright--<br/>
     And this was odd, because it was<br/>
      The middle of the night.</p>
<p>     The moon was shining sulkily,<br/>
      Because she thought the sun<br/>
     Had got no business to be there<br/>
      After the day was done--<br/>
     "It's very rude of him," she said,<br/>
      "To come and spoil the fun!"</p>
<p>     The sea was wet as wet could be,<br/>
      The sands were dry as dry.<br/>
     You could not see a cloud, because<br/>
      No cloud was in the sky:<br/>
     No birds were flying over head--<br/>
      There were no birds to fly.</p>
<p>     The Walrus and the Carpenter<br/>
      Were walking close at hand;<br/>
     They wept like anything to see<br/>
      Such quantities of sand:<br/>
     "If this were only cleared away,"<br/>
      They said, "it WOULD be grand!"</p>
<p>     "If seven maids with seven mops<br/>
      Swept it for half a year,<br/>
     Do you suppose," the Walrus said,<br/>
      "That they could get it clear?"<br/>
     "I doubt it," said the Carpenter,<br/>
      And shed a bitter tear.</p>
<p>     "O Oysters, come and walk with us!"<br/>
      The Walrus did beseech.<br/>
     "A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,<br/>
      Along the briny beach:<br/>
     We cannot do with more than four,<br/>
      To give a hand to each."</p>
<p>     The eldest Oyster looked at him.<br/>
      But never a word he said:<br/>
     The eldest Oyster winked his eye,<br/>
      And shook his heavy head--<br/>
     Meaning to say he did not choose<br/>
      To leave the oyster-bed.</p>
<p>     But four young oysters hurried up,<br/>
      All eager for the treat:<br/>
     Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,<br/>
      Their shoes were clean and neat--<br/>
     And this was odd, because, you know,<br/>
      They hadn't any feet.</p>
<p>     Four other Oysters followed them,<br/>
      And yet another four;<br/>
     And thick and fast they came at last,<br/>
      And more, and more, and more--<br/>
     All hopping through the frothy waves,<br/>
      And scrambling to the shore.</p>
<p>     The Walrus and the Carpenter<br/>
      Walked on a mile or so,<br/>
     And then they rested on a rock<br/>
      Conveniently low:<br/>
     And all the little Oysters stood<br/>
      And waited in a row.</p>
<p>     "The time has come," the Walrus said,<br/>
      "To talk of many things:<br/>
     Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--<br/>
      Of cabbages--and kings--<br/>
     And why the sea is boiling hot--<br/>
      And whether pigs have wings."</p>
<p>     "But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,<br/>
      "Before we have our chat;<br/>
     For some of us are out of breath,<br/>
      And all of us are fat!"<br/>
     "No hurry!" said the Carpenter.<br/>
      They thanked him much for that.</p>
<p>     "A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,<br/>
      "Is what we chiefly need:<br/>
     Pepper and vinegar besides<br/>
      Are very good indeed--<br/>
     Now if you're ready Oysters dear,<br/>
      We can begin to feed."</p>
<p>     "But not on us!" the Oysters cried,<br/>
      Turning a little blue,<br/>
     "After such kindness, that would be<br/>
      A dismal thing to do!"<br/>
     "The night is fine," the Walrus said<br/>
      "Do you admire the view?</p>
<p>     "It was so kind of you to come!<br/>
      And you are very nice!"<br/>
     The Carpenter said nothing but<br/>
      "Cut us another slice:<br/>
     I wish you were not quite so deaf--<br/>
      I've had to ask you twice!"</p>
<p>     "It seems a shame," the Walrus said,<br/>
      "To play them such a trick,<br/>
     After we've brought them out so far,<br/>
      And made them trot so quick!"<br/>
     The Carpenter said nothing but<br/>
      "The butter's spread too thick!"</p>
<p>     "I weep for you," the Walrus said.<br/>
      "I deeply sympathize."<br/>
     With sobs and tears he sorted out<br/>
      Those of the largest size.<br/>
     Holding his pocket handkerchief<br/>
      Before his streaming eyes.</p>
<p>     "O Oysters," said the Carpenter.<br/>
      "You've had a pleasant run!<br/>
     Shall we be trotting home again?"<br/>
      But answer came there none--<br/>
     And that was scarcely odd, because<br/>
      They'd eaten every one.'</p>
<p>"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy," said Alice: "I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since
the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing
that we should not have known her again."</p>
<p>"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Tweedledee. "He
only told me what I have now told you."</p>
<p>"The country," Alice said indignantly. "can in general supply but a few subjects for
such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
unvarying society."</p>
<p>"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?" said Tweedledum.</p>
<p>This was a puzzler. After a pause, Alice began, "_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," Here she checked herself in some alarm,
at hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a large
steam-engine in the wood near them, though she feared it was more likely
to be a wild beast. "and I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such
an exhibition." she
asked timidly.</p>
<p>"A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.
Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.
Bingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be
got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this
moment." said Tweedledee.</p>
<p>"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted." the brothers cried, and they each took one of
Alice's hands, and led her up to where the King was sleeping.</p>
<p>"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
How much I shall have to tell!" said Tweedledum.</p>
<p>Alice couldn't say honestly that he was. He had a tall red night-cap on,
with a tassel, and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap,
and snoring loud--"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from
any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that
I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect
me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes
alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of
_myself_, but I dread other people's remarks." as Tweedledum remarked.</p>
<p>"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with
quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?" said Alice,
who was a very thoughtful little girl.</p>
<p>"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam," said Tweedledee: "but if
she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not
to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."</p>
<p>Alice said "Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could
not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and
he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the
world."</p>
<p>"I have been making the tour of the park," Tweedledee exclaimed, clapping his hands triumphantly.
"as I generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are
you going much farther?"</p>
<p>"You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really
amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for
it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love." said Alice.</p>
<p>"I am grieved indeed," Tweedledee retorted contemptuously. "grieved--shocked. But is it
certain--absolutely certain?"</p>
<p>"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," added Tweedledum, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner
was so little to be trusted."</p>
<p>"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," Alice exclaimed indignantly. "but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of
seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your
modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification."</p>
<p>"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied." said Tweedledum.</p>
<p>"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it." cried Tweedledee.</p>
<p>He shouted this so loud that Alice couldn't help saying, "As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for
writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to
do."</p>
<p>"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" said Tweedledum, "That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a
laugh."</p>
<p>"And how impossible in others!" said Alice and began to cry.</p>
<p>"You certainly do," Tweedledee remarked:
"but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome."</p>
<p>"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet," Alice said--half-laughing through her tears, it all
seemed so ridiculous--"we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well
she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her
twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand
up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,
and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,
and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--"</p>
<p>"We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write
again till he had something of importance to mention." Tweedledum interrupted
in a tone of great contempt.</p>
<p>"You doubt me," Alice thought to herself: "indeed, you have
no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A
little time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better." So she brushed away her tears, and went on as
cheerfully as she could. "Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,
Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us."</p>
<p>Tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother, and
looked up into it. "For we must attribute this happy conclusion," he said: "in a great
measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to
assist Mr. Wickham with money."</p>
<p>"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over."</p>
<p>"With three younger sisters grown up," said Tweedledee: "your
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."</p>
<p>"Ah!" thought Alice, and she was just going to say
"then she is better off than
many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?" and leave them, when Tweedledum sprang out from under the
umbrella and seized her by the wrist.</p>
<p>"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady
Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour
to wait for any opening of yours. My aunt's intelligence had given me
hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing." he said, in a voice choking with passion, and
his eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment, as he pointed with a
trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree.</p>
<p>"But surely," Alice said, after a careful examination of the
little white thing. "I may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me." she added hastily,
thinking that he was frightened: "Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility."</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," cried Tweedledum, beginning to stamp about wildly and
tear his hair. "Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant." Here he looked at Tweedledee,
who immediately sat down on the ground, and tried to hide himself under
the umbrella.</p>
<p>Alice laid her hand upon his arm, and said in a soothing tone, "A little."</p>
<p>"If you were aware," Tweedledum cried, in a greater fury than ever. "of the very great disadvantage to
us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and
imprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you
would judge differently in the affair." and his
voice rose to a perfect scream.</p>
<p>All this time Tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella,
with himself in it: which was such an extraordinary thing to do, that it
quite took off Alice's attention from the angry brother. But he couldn't
quite succeed, and it ended in his rolling over, bundled up in the
umbrella, with only his head out: and there he lay, opening and shutting
his mouth and his large eyes--"How long did you say he was at Rosings?" Alice thought.</p>
<p>"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between
us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What
could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman
in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a
stupider person." Tweedledum said in a calmer
tone.</p>
<p>"It may do very well for the others," the other sulkily replied, as he crawled out of the
umbrella: "but I am
sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?"</p>
<p>So the two brothers went off hand-in-hand into the wood, and returned
in a minute with their arms full of things--such as bolsters, blankets,
hearth-rugs, table-cloths, dish-covers and coal-scuttles. "Removed!" Tweedledum remarked. "It must not be thought of. My sister, I am
sure, will not hear of her removal."</p>
<p>Alice said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made about anything
in all her life--the way those two bustled about--and the quantity of
things they put on--and the trouble they gave her in tying strings and
fastening buttons--"Read it aloud," she said to herself, as
she arranged a bolster round the neck of Tweedledee, "for I hardly know myself what it is
about." as he said.</p>
<p>"I am not now to learn," he added very gravely, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a
third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."</p>
<p>Alice laughed aloud: but she managed to turn it into a cough, for fear
of hurting his feelings.</p>
<p>"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball." said Tweedledum, coming up to have his helmet
tied on. (He CALLED it a helmet, though it certainly looked much more
like a saucepan.)</p>
<p>"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it." Alice replied gently.</p>
<p>"And yours," he went on in a low voice: "is willfully to misunderstand
them."</p>
<p>"This will not do," said Tweedledee, who had overheard the
remark. "you never will be able to make both
of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's;
but you shall do as you choose."</p>
<p>"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You
must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment
of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may
be considered, therefore, as finally settled." said Alice, thinking it a good
opportunity to make peace.</p>
<p>"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,"
said Tweedledum. "but this was
all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite
escaped my notice."</p>
<p>Tweedledee looked at his watch, and said "Dear Lizzy!"</p>
<p>"Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may
observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But
_now_ we may be silent." said Tweedledum.</p>
<p>"Oh!" the other said, rather sadly: "Charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest." he added: "What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to
_insist_ upon her marrying him."</p>
<p>"It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased," cried Tweedledum, "I am going
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."</p>
<p>Alice laughed. "You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
she said.</p>
<p>Tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile. "Not that I _shall_, though,"
he said, "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out."</p>
<p>"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said Alice, still hoping to make them a LITTLE
ashamed of fighting for such a trifle.</p>
<p>"He is also handsome," said Tweedledum, "which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete."</p>
<p>"Certainly," thought Alice.</p>
<p>"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley," Tweedledum said to his brother:
"for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure
you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement."</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am, all." said Tweedledee.</p>
<p>It was getting dark so suddenly that Alice thought there must be a
thunderstorm coming on. "Another time, Lizzy," she said.
"I would not dance with _him_,
if I were you."</p>
<p>"It is
very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so." Tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of alarm: and
the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment.</p>
<p>Alice ran a little way into the wood, and stopped under a large tree.
"I might as well inquire," she thought: "why with so evident a desire
of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have
other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against
you--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you
think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has
been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most
beloved sister?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>
CHAPTER V. Wool and Water</p>
<p>She caught the shawl as she spoke, and looked about for the owner: in
another moment the White Queen came running wildly through the wood,
with both arms stretched out wide, as if she were flying, and Alice very
civilly went to meet her with the shawl.</p>
<p>"She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!" Alice said, as she helped
her to put on her shawl again.</p>
<p>The White Queen only looked at her in a helpless frightened sort of way,
and kept repeating something in a whisper to herself that sounded like
"But if you have got them to-day," and Alice felt that if there was
to be any conversation at all, she must manage it herself. So she began
rather timidly: "my mother's purpose
will be answered."</p>
<p>"Really, Mr. Collins," The Queen said. "you puzzle me
exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
to convince you of its being one."</p>
<p>Alice thought it would never do to have an argument at the very
beginning of their conversation, so she smiled and said, "I have no wish of denying
that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been
kinder than towards myself."</p>
<p>"delightful," groaned the poor Queen. "charming,"</p>
<p>It would have been all the better, as it seemed to Alice, if she had got
some one else to dress her, she was so dreadfully untidy. "I found," Alice thought to herself, "as the time drew near that I had better not meet
Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself." she added aloud.</p>
<p>"On the evening before my going to London," the Queen said, in a
melancholy voice. "I made a
confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I
told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had
the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."</p>
<p>"She had better have stayed at home," Alice
said, as she gently put it right for her; "perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see
too little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence
insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."</p>
<p>"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," the Queen said with a sigh. "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves."</p>
<p>Alice carefully released the brush, and did her best to get the hair
into order. "He is now gone into the army," she said, after altering
most of the pins. "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."</p>
<p>"I see what you are feeling," the Queen said. "You must be surprised,
very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry
you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be
satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never
was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's
character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state."</p>
<p>Alice couldn't help laughing, as she said, "Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is
wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces
of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day that I recommended another young person,
who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's
calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. 'Lady
Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your
younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"</p>
<p>"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" said the Queen.</p>
<p>"I take no leave
of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve
no such attention. I am most seriously displeased."</p>
<p>"I assure you, madam," the Queen said. "that she does not need such advice.
She practises very constantly."</p>
<p>"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it." Alice objected.</p>
<p>"He is as fine a fellow," said the Queen. "as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to
us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law."</p>
<p>"Oh, no!" said Alice. "In essentials, I believe, he is very much
what he ever was."</p>
<p>"It ought to be good," the Queen said kindly: "it has been the work of many
generations."</p>
<p>"If we make haste," Alice repeated in great astonishment. "perhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter before he goes."</p>
<p>"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required. A thousand things may arise in six months!"</p>
<p>"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" Alice remarked. "What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!
But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their
journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her
side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!"</p>
<p>"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know
that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?" the Queen
remarked.</p>
<p>"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her." Alice ventured to ask.</p>
<p>"I have found out," the Queen replied in a
careless tone. "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady
Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have
thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to
do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology." she went on, sticking a large piece
of plaster [band-aid] on her finger as she spoke, "You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,
you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible."</p>
<p>"Yes, she did." said Alice.</p>
<p>"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I
can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_." the Queen said, as she
bound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon.</p>
<p>Alice felt there was no denying THAT. "I have heard much of your master's fine person," she said: "it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not."</p>
<p>"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said the Queen: "It must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year."</p>
<p>"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that
you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as
dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better
stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not
go--and at another word, might stay a month." said Alice.</p>
<p>"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!" the Queen said
triumphantly.</p>
<p>"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Alice:
"but I
wish he had danced with Eliza."</p>
<p>"Miss Eliza Bennet," the Queen said, "despises cards. She is a great
reader, and has no pleasure in anything else." Her voice went higher
with each "You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the
first, you may remember." till it got quite to a squeak at last.</p>
<p>Alice was just beginning to say "I have no right to give _my_ opinion," when
the Queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence
unfinished. "as to his being
agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_
to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else. Here you are in your own family." shouted the Queen, shaking her hand about as
if she wanted to shake it off. "Nonsense,
nonsense!"</p>
<p>Her screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steam-engine, that
Alice had to hold both her hands over her ears.</p>
<p>"No," she said, as soon as there was a chance of making
herself heard. "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."</p>
<p>"Yes," the Queen said, "his estate there is a noble one. A clear
ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more
capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for
I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my
infancy."</p>
<p>"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home." Alice asked, feeling very much inclined
to laugh.</p>
<p>"You may readily comprehend," the poor Queen groaned out: "what my curiosity must be
to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively
speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems
to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance." As she said the words the brooch
flew open, and the Queen clutched wildly at it, and tried to clasp it
again.</p>
<p>"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," cried Alice. "_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice." And she
caught at the brooch; but it was too late: the pin had slipped, and the
Queen had pricked her finger.</p>
<p>"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," she said to Alice with a
smile. "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.
Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,
nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing
everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman."</p>
<p>"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?" Alice asked, holding her hands ready to
put over her ears again.</p>
<p>"My father and Maria are coming to me in March," said the Queen. "and I
hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as
welcome as either of them."</p>
<p>By this time it was getting light. "If it was to be secret," said Alice: "say not another word on the
subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further."</p>
<p>"His pride," the Queen said. "does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud."</p>
<p>"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do
you draw?" Alice said in a melancholy voice; and
at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down her
cheeks.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it would have been better," cried the poor Queen, wringing her hands in
despair. "But to expose
the former faults of any person without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions."</p>
<p>Alice could not help laughing at this, even in the midst of her tears.
"But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has
not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence of
mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will
not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a
subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself." she asked.</p>
<p>"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," the Queen said with great decision: "and pray what is the result?"</p>
<p>"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear."</p>
<p>"It
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," the Queen remarked: "I am
sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such
as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent."</p>
<p>"I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to anyone but myself." said Alice.</p>
<p>"It taught me to hope," the Queen said in a pitying tone. "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."</p>
<p>Alice laughed. "I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" she said: "Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but
such another man for you!"</p>
<p>"And Mary King is safe!" said the Queen. "safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune."</p>
<p>The brooch had come undone as she spoke, and a sudden gust of wind blew
the Queen's shawl across a little brook. The Queen spread out her arms
again, and went flying after it, and this time she succeeded in catching
it for herself. "Do let us have a little music," she cried in a triumphant tone. "Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr. Hurst?"</p>
<p>"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of
Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must
say that I hate the very sight of him." Alice said very politely, as
she crossed the little brook after the Queen.</p>
<p>  *    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>  *    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>"Good gracious!" cried the Queen, her voice rising to a squeak as she
went on. "if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with
our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's
way." The last
word ended in a long bleat, so like a sheep that Alice quite started.</p>
<p>She looked at the Queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up
in wool. Alice rubbed her eyes, and looked again. She couldn't make out
what had happened at all. Was she in a shop? And was that really--was it
really a SHEEP that was sitting on the other side of the counter? Rub as
she could, she could make nothing more of it: she was in a little dark
shop, leaning with her elbows on the counter, and opposite to her was
an old Sheep, sitting in an arm-chair knitting, and every now and then
leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles.</p>
<p>"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion
for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you
for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved." the Sheep said at last, looking up for a
moment from her knitting.</p>
<p>"Go, my dear," Alice said, very gently. "and show her ladyship about the
different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."</p>
<p>"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," said the
Sheep: "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be
a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.
Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now."</p>
<p>But these, as it happened, Alice had NOT got: so she contented herself
with turning round, looking at the shelves as she came to them.</p>
<p>The shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things--but the
oddest part of it all was, that whenever she looked hard at any shelf,
to make out exactly what it had on it, that particular shelf was always
quite empty: though the others round it were crowded as full as they
could hold.</p>
<p>"Dear madam," she said at last in a plaintive tone, after
she had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a large bright thing,
that looked sometimes like a doll and sometimes like a work-box, and was
always in the shelf next above the one she was looking at. "don't you know
there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here
this half-hour, and master has had a letter." she added, as a
sudden thought struck her, "Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of
myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it."</p>
<p>But even this plan failed: the "Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?" went through the ceiling as
quietly as possible, as if it were quite used to it.</p>
<p>"I will not trust myself on the subject," the Sheep said, as she took up another
pair of needles. "I can hardly
be just to him." She was now working with fourteen pairs at once, and Alice
couldn't help looking at her in great astonishment.</p>
<p>"Well," the puzzled child thought to herself.
"I wish Jane success with all my heart; and
if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or
ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life."</p>
<p>"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was
ill at Netherfield?" the Sheep asked, handing her a pair of knitting-needles
as she spoke.</p>
<p>"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here." Alice was
beginning to say, when suddenly the needles turned into oars in her
hands, and she found they were in a little boat, gliding along between
banks: so there was nothing for it but to do her best.</p>
<p>"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire." cried the Sheep, as she took up another pair of needles.</p>
<p>This didn't sound like a remark that needed any answer, so Alice said
nothing, but pulled away. There was something very queer about the
water, she thought, as every now and then the oars got fast in it, and
would hardly come out again.</p>
<p>"Then it is as I always hoped," the Sheep cried again, taking more needles. "they are married!"</p>
<p>"Let me write for you," thought Alice. "if you dislike the trouble
yourself."</p>
<p>"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him." the Sheep cried angrily, taking up
quite a bunch of needles.</p>
<p>"She did not choose it," said Alice: "she would go."</p>
<p>"What an excellent father you have, girls!" said the Sheep, sticking some of the needles
into her hair, as her hands were full. "I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so
pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball."</p>
<p>"Lizzy," Alice asked at last, rather vexed.
"I have given him my consent. He is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he
condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know
your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape
discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are
about."</p>
<p>"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said the Sheep: "will
she be as tall as I am?"</p>
<p>This offended Alice a little, so there was no more conversation for a
minute or two, while the boat glided gently on, sometimes among beds of
weeds (which made the oars stick fast in the water, worse then ever),
and sometimes under trees, but always with the same tall river-banks
frowning over their heads.</p>
<p>"My dear," Alice cried in a sudden
transport of delight. "I have two small favours to request.
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be."</p>
<p>"Have you any other objection," the Sheep said, without
looking up from her knitting: "than your belief of my
indifference?"</p>
<p>"Pride," Alice pleaded. "is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may
be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."</p>
<p>"You used us abominably ill," said the Sheep. "running away without
telling us that you were coming out."</p>
<p>So the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would, till it
glided gently in among the waving rushes. And then the little sleeves
were carefully rolled up, and the little arms were plunged in elbow-deep
to get the rushes a good long way down before breaking them off--and for
a while Alice forgot all about the Sheep and the knitting, as she
bent over the side of the boat, with just the ends of her tangled hair
dipping into the water--while with bright eager eyes she caught at one
bunch after another of the darling scented rushes.</p>
<p>"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," she said to herself. "and therefore if I
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here." 'And it certainly DID
seem a little provoking ("Mr. Darcy is all politeness," she
thought) that, though she managed to pick plenty of beautiful rushes as
the boat glided by, there was always a more lovely one that she couldn't
reach.</p>
<p>"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did." she said at last, with a sigh at the
obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off, as, with flushed cheeks
and dripping hair and hands, she scrambled back into her place, and
began to arrange her new-found treasures.</p>
<p>What mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to fade, and
to lose all their scent and beauty, from the very moment that she
picked them? Even real scented rushes, you know, last only a very little
while--and these, being dream-rushes, melted away almost like snow, as
they lay in heaps at her feet--but Alice hardly noticed this, there were
so many other curious things to think about.</p>
<p>They hadn't gone much farther before the blade of one of the oars got
fast in the water and WOULDN'T come out again (so Alice explained it
afterwards), and the consequence was that the handle of it caught her
under the chin, and, in spite of a series of little shrieks of "What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear." from poor Alice, it swept her straight off the seat, and down among
the heap of rushes.</p>
<p>However, she wasn't hurt, and was soon up again: the Sheep went on with
her knitting all the while, just as if nothing had happened. "About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago
I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases." she remarked, as Alice got back into her place,
very much relieved to find herself still in the boat.</p>
<p>"Their conduct has been such," Said Alice, peeping cautiously over the side
of the boat into the dark water. "as neither you, nor
I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it." But the Sheep only
laughed scornfully, and went on with her knitting.</p>
<p>"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false
friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did
before him?" said Alice.</p>
<p>"Good God! what is the matter?" said the Sheep: "I will not detain you a minute;
but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are
not well enough; you cannot go yourself."</p>
<p>"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?" Alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half
frightened--for the oars, and the boat, and the river, had vanished all
in a moment, and she was back again in the little dark shop.</p>
<p>"He must be an oddity, I think," she said timidly. "I cannot make him
out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he
mean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he
would help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?"</p>
<p>"To-morrow fortnight." the Sheep replied.</p>
<p>"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife." Alice said in a surprised tone, taking
out her purse.</p>
<p>"Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight." said the Sheep.</p>
<p>"Except," said Alice, as she put the money down on
the counter. For she thought to herself, "when she goes to Ramsgate."</p>
<p>The Sheep took the money, and put it away in a box: then she said "She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
Why does she not come in?" And so saying, she went off to the other end of the
shop, and set the egg upright on a shelf.</p>
<p>"You can now have nothing further to say," thought Alice, as she groped her way
among the tables and chairs, for the shop was very dark towards the end.
"You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to
the house."</p>
<p>  *    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>  *    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>
So she went on, wondering more and more at every step, as everything
turned into a tree the moment she came up to it, and she quite expected
the egg to do the same.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
CHAPTER VI. Humpty Dumpty</p>
<p>However, the egg only got larger and larger, and more and more human:
when she had come within a few yards of it, she saw that it had eyes
and a nose and mouth; and when she had come close to it, she saw clearly
that it was HUMPTY DUMPTY himself. "Oh! yes--it would be much better to
wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball," she said
to herself. "I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."</p>
<p>It might have been written a hundred times, easily, on that enormous
face. Humpty Dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed, like a Turk, on
the top of a high wall--such a narrow one that Alice quite wondered how
he could keep his balance--and, as his eyes were steadily fixed in the
opposite direction, and he didn't take the least notice of her, she
thought he must be a stuffed figure after all.</p>
<p>"An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles." she said aloud, standing with her
hands ready to catch him, for she was every moment expecting him to
fall.</p>
<p>"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," Humpty Dumpty said after a long silence, looking
away from Alice as he spoke, "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the
matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I
am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends
would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is
not adequate to the risk!"</p>
<p>"No," Alice gently explained. "Wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him,
in the very beginning of our relationship." she added, hoping to turn her remark
into a sort of a compliment.</p>
<p>"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Humpty Dumpty, looking away from her as usual, "Shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?"</p>
<p>Alice didn't know what to say to this: it wasn't at all like
conversation, she thought, as he never said anything to HER; in fact,
his last remark was evidently addressed to a tree--so she stood and
softly repeated to herself:--</p>
<p><br/>
     "Elizabeth, you are not serious now."</p>
<p>
"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such
a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is
impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him? Oh! no." she added, almost out
loud, forgetting that Humpty Dumpty would hear her.</p>
<p>"I believe her to be both in a great degree," Humpty Dumpty
said, looking at her for the first time, "I have
not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her
nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an
understanding of the first class."</p>
<p>"Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it
some day. Do your sisters play and sing?"</p>
<p>"With the officers!" Humpty Dumpty interrupted impatiently.
"I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_."</p>
<p>"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood." Alice asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," Humpty Dumpty said with a short laugh: "and a most attentive neighbour."</p>
<p>"Perhaps we might be deceived." said Alice, not wishing to begin an
argument.</p>
<p>"Nay," cried Humpty Dumpty. "this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want
to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not
be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people
whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see
of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or
sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the
other is Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is
unaccountable!"</p>
<p>"My dear madam," Alice went on, not
with any idea of making another riddle, but simply in her good-natured
anxiety for the queer creature. "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and
you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible."</p>
<p>"About a month," Humpty Dumpty growled out. "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand." Here he pursed up his lips and looked so solemn
and grand that Alice could hardly help laughing. "You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner." he
went on, "But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he must find it out."</p>
<p>"Can I have the carriage?" Alice interrupted, rather
unwisely.</p>
<p>"I hope, my dear," Humpty Dumpty cried, breaking into a
sudden passion. "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."</p>
<p>"La!" Alice said very gently. "it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud man."</p>
<p>"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins," Humpty Dumpty said in
a calmer tone. "that Lizzy shall be
brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very
headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will
_make_ her know it." And he grinned almost from ear to ear, as he
leant forwards (and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so)
and offered Alice his hand. She watched him a little anxiously as she
took it. "Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so
disagreeable." she thought: "Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't
at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?"</p>
<p>"Aye, there she comes," Humpty Dumpty went on. "looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided
she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it
into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep
you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told
you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,
and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking
to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking
to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have
no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it
is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied."</p>
<p>"Perfectly so, I thank you." Alice said very politely.</p>
<p>"Oh! my dear brother," said Humpty Dumpty, "that is exactly what I
could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,
after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my
wits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such
spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that
I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to
give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does
not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I
know you will contrive it all." ("I have already told her so once, by your desire."
thought Alice.) "LYDIA BENNET."</p>
<p>Alice made a short calculation, and said "And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?"</p>
<p>"What can be the meaning of this?" Humpty Dumpty exclaimed triumphantly. "My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never
have called us in this familiar way."</p>
<p>"I must ask whether you were surprised?" Alice explained.</p>
<p>"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at
court." said Humpty Dumpty.</p>
<p>Alice didn't want to begin another argument, so she said nothing.</p>
<p>"And of your infliction," Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully. "You have reduced
him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have
withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for
him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and
ridicule."</p>
<p>"I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten
minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!" Alice said indignantly.</p>
<p>"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him." the other inquired.</p>
<p>Alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion. "Lizzy," she said,
"remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."</p>
<p>"My dearest child," said Humpty Dumpty, "I can think of nothing else! Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a
special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,
that I may have it to-morrow."</p>
<p>"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood." Alice suddenly remarked.</p>
<p>(They had had quite enough of the subject of age, she thought: and if
they really were to take turns in choosing subjects, it was her turn
now.) "Mamma," she corrected herself on second thoughts, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library." she
added in dismay, for Humpty Dumpty looked thoroughly offended, and she
began to wish she hadn't chosen that subject. "I must not decide on my own performance." she
thought to herself, "Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."</p>
<p>Evidently Humpty Dumpty was very angry, though he said nothing for a
minute or two. When he DID speak again, it was in a deep growl.</p>
<p>"Upon my word, sir," he said at last, "your hope is a rather
extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_
happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation."</p>
<p>"And you saw him frequently?" Alice said, in so humble a tone that
Humpty Dumpty relented.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire
was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the
case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could
it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was
settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening
her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be
in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a
consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far
enough from my thoughts."</p>
<p>"I do not get on at all. I hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly." said Alice, quite pleased to find that she HAD chosen a
good subject, after all.</p>
<p>"They have none of them much to recommend them," Humpty Dumpty continued thoughtfully, as he crossed
one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it, "they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters."</p>
<p>"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much
you dislike him." Alice said with a puzzled air.</p>
<p>"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents." said Humpty Dumpty.</p>
<p>"Mrs.
Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the
impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."</p>
<p>"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces."</p>
<p>Alice considered a little. "Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I
must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,
I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed
delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?" she said at
last.</p>
<p>"Already arisen?" cried Humpty Dumpty. "What, has she frightened away
some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity
are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who
have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."</p>
<p>"How so? How can it affect them?" said Alice.</p>
<p>"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your
mother."</p>
<p>"Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal."</p>
<p>"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing
when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner."</p>
<p>"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to Netherfield again?"</p>
<p>Humpty Dumpty looked doubtful. "Do you suppose them to be in London?" he
said.</p>
<p>Alice couldn't help smiling as she took out her memorandum-book, and
worked the sum for him:</p>
<p><br/>
               365<br/>
                1<br/>
               ____</p>
<p>               364<br/>
               ___</p>
<p>Humpty Dumpty took the book, and looked at it carefully. "Thank you--but I always mend my own." he began.</p>
<p>"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?" Alice interrupted.</p>
<p>"I cannot pretend to be sorry," Humpty Dumpty said gaily, as she turned it round for
him. "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen."</p>
<p>"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation." said Alice.</p>
<p>"My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let
me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me
how long you have loved him?"</p>
<p>"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," Alice said.</p>
<p>Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously. "To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by
it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country-town indifference to decorum."</p>
<p>"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There
is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the
will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate
me." Alice objected.</p>
<p>"Yet it is hard," Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, "that this poor man cannot
come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself."</p>
<p>"It is unlucky," said Alice, "that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by
them."</p>
<p>"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said Humpty Dumpty, "Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in
my dressing-room."</p>
<p>Alice was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minute Humpty
Dumpty began again. "Can you deny that you have done it?"</p>
<p>"When I consider," said Alice "that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what
he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I
learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not
have happened. But it is all--all too late now."</p>
<p>"When I am in the country," said Humpty Dumpty, looking very
much pleased. "I never wish to leave it;
and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."</p>
<p>"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy." Alice said in a thoughtful
tone.</p>
<p>"Oh! my dear," said Humpty Dumpty, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it."</p>
<p>"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence." said Alice. She was too much puzzled to make any other remark.</p>
<p>"While I can have my mornings to myself," Humpty
Dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to side: "it is enough--I
think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those
who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
everybody."</p>
<p>(Alice didn't venture to ask what he paid them with; and so you see I
can't tell YOU.)</p>
<p>"She is happy then," said Alice. "and her residence there
will probably be of some duration."</p>
<p>"Now," said Humpty Dumpty. "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly
seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance."</p>
<p>This sounded very hopeful, so Alice repeated the first verse:</p>
<p>     'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br/>
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br/>
     All mimsy were the borogoves,<br/>
      And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
<p>"This is a parade," Humpty Dumpty interrupted: "which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my
library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as
I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away."</p>
<p>"Well, my dear," said Alice: "I have no more to
say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with
you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy."</p>
<p>"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?
They must be a great loss to _your_ family."</p>
<p>"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes," Alice remarked thoughtfully: "since we are not to visit."</p>
<p>"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."</p>
<p>"_That_ you certainly shall."</p>
<p>"Oh!" said Humpty Dumpty: "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
youngest, I'm the tallest."</p>
<p>"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes."</p>
<p>"Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?"</p>
<p>"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion." said
Alice, surprised at her own ingenuity.</p>
<p>"I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."</p>
<p>"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,
_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think
Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;
and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of
her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;
her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?" Alice added.</p>
<p>"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"</p>
<p>"When I wrote that letter," said Alice. "I believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit."</p>
<p>"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a
word about it till now."</p>
<p>"And men take care that they should."</p>
<p>"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips."</p>
<p>"Yes, madam," said Alice. "She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man
who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family."</p>
<p>"Oh! Jane," said Humpty Dumpty, stretching out one of his
great hands, "was there a servant belonging to it who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"</p>
<p>"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time." Alice hastily said, hoping to keep him
from beginning.</p>
<p>"I am sure," he went on without noticing her remark,
"I cried for two days together when Colonel
Miller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart."</p>
<p>Alice felt that in that case she really OUGHT to listen to it, so she
sat down, and said "I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him." rather sadly.</p>
<p><br/>
     'In winter, when the fields are white,<br/>
     I sing this song for your delight--</p>
<p>
only I don't sing it,' he added, as an explanation.</p>
<p>"Yes, or I will never see her again." said Alice.</p>
<p>"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect
forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant
female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking
the truth from her heart." Humpty Dumpty remarked severely. Alice was silent.</p>
<p><br/>
     "How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!"</p>
<p>
"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively
handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw
anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.
Hurst's gown--" said Alice.</p>
<p><br/>
     "And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.
I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you
reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point."</p>
<p>
"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at
Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?" said Alice.</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" Humpty Dumpty said:
"but how could _that_ be? How could his
will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?"</p>
<p>     'I sent a message to the fish:<br/>
     I told them "This is what I wish."</p>
<p>     The little fishes of the sea,<br/>
     They sent an answer back to me.</p>
<p>     The little fishes' answer was<br/>
     "We cannot do it, Sir, because--"'</p>
<p>
"Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love." said Alice.</p>
<p>"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling
colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is
all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage." Humpty Dumpty replied.</p>
<p><br/>
     'I sent to them again to say<br/>
     "It will be better to obey."</p>
<p>     The fishes answered with a grin,<br/>
     "Why, what a temper you are in!"</p>
<p>     I told them once, I told them twice:<br/>
     They would not listen to advice.</p>
<p>     I took a kettle large and new,<br/>
     Fit for the deed I had to do.</p>
<p>     My heart went hop, my heart went thump;<br/>
     I filled the kettle at the pump.</p>
<p>     Then some one came to me and said,<br/>
     "The little fishes are in bed."</p>
<p>     I said to him, I said it plain,<br/>
     "Then you must wake them up again."</p>
<p>     I said it very loud and clear;<br/>
     I went and shouted in his ear.'</p>
<p>
Humpty Dumpty raised his voice almost to a scream as he repeated this
verse, and Alice thought with a shudder, "Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
Mr. Bingley to _her_."</p>
<p><br/>
     'But he was very stiff and proud;<br/>
     He said "You needn't shout so loud!"</p>
<p>     And he was very proud and stiff;<br/>
     He said "I'd go and wake them, if--"</p>
<p>     I took a corkscrew from the shelf:<br/>
     I went to wake them up myself.</p>
<p>     And when I found the door was locked,<br/>
     I pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked.</p>
<p>     And when I found the door was shut,<br/>
     I tried to turn the handle, but--'</p>
<p>
There was a long pause.</p>
<p>"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly
well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
Meryton?" Alice timidly asked.</p>
<p>"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said Humpty Dumpty. "Of what are you talking?"</p>
<p>This was rather sudden, Alice thought: but, after such a VERY strong
hint that she ought to be going, she felt that it would hardly be civil
to stay. So she got up, and held out her hand. "I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," she said as cheerfully as she could.</p>
<p>"There is also one other person in the party," Humpty Dumpty replied in
a discontented tone, giving her one of his fingers to shake; "who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow
me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at Lambton?"</p>
<p>"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man." Alice remarked in a
thoughtful tone.</p>
<p>"I hope," said Humpty Dumpty. "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses." (marking their places in the
air with this thumb) "stupid,
disagreeable fellows."</p>
<p>"It is evident by this," Alice objected. But Humpty Dumpty only shut his
eyes and said "that he comes back no more this
winter."</p>
<p>Alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again, but as he never
opened his eyes or took any further notice of her, she said "La! my dear,"
once more, and, getting no answer to this, she quietly walked away:
but she couldn't help saying to herself as she went, "it is not
Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;
the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little
creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?" (she repeated this aloud, as it was a great comfort to
have such a long word to say) "Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
Scotland." She never finished the sentence, for at this moment a heavy crash
shook the forest from end to end.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
CHAPTER VII. The Lion and the Unicorn</p>
<p>The next moment soldiers came running through the wood, at first in twos
and threes, then ten or twenty together, and at last in such crowds that
they seemed to fill the whole forest. Alice got behind a tree, for fear
of being run over, and watched them go by.</p>
<p>She thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers so
uncertain on their feet: they were always tripping over something or
other, and whenever one went down, several more always fell over him, so
that the ground was soon covered with little heaps of men.</p>
<p>Then came the horses. Having four feet, these managed rather better than
the foot-soldiers: but even THEY stumbled now and then; and it seemed
to be a regular rule that, whenever a horse stumbled the rider fell off
instantly. The confusion got worse every moment, and Alice was very glad
to get out of the wood into an open place, where she found the White
King seated on the ground, busily writing in his memorandum-book.</p>
<p>"I want to know," the King cried in a tone of delight, on seeing
Alice. "what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pardon."</p>
<p>"You may depend on it," said Alice: "for Mrs. Nicholls was in
Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He
comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was
going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed."</p>
<p>"Nothing is more deceitful," the King
said, referring to his book. "than the appearance of
humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast."</p>
<p>"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be
finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?" said Alice.</p>
<p>"Mr. Collins," the King remarked in a fretful tone.
"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."</p>
<p>All this was lost on Alice, who was still looking intently along
the road, shading her eyes with one hand. "No more have I," she
exclaimed at last. "and I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you." (For the messenger kept skipping up and down,
and wriggling like an eel, as he came along, with his great hands spread
out like fans on each side.)</p>
<p>"Good gracious!" said the King. "it seems
but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have
happened!" (He pronounced it so as to rhyme with "It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked
about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size
of the room, or the number of couples.")</p>
<p>"No really," Alice couldn't help beginning, "I think there cannot be too little said
on the subject."</p>
<p>"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," the King remarked simply, without the least idea
that he was joining in the game, while Alice was still hesitating for
the name of a town beginning with H. "Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_."</p>
<p>"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At
present I have not room to do them justice." said Alice.</p>
<p>"His father was an excellent man," said the King.</p>
<p>"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," said Alice. "I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day."</p>
<p>"How could
you begin?" the King repeated impatiently. "I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?"</p>
<p>At this moment the Messenger arrived: he was far too much out of breath
to say a word, and could only wave his hands about, and make the most
fearful faces at the poor King.</p>
<p>"Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as
if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know." the King said, introducing Alice
in the hope of turning off the Messenger's attention from himself--but
it was no use--the Anglo-Saxon attitudes only got more extraordinary
every moment, while the great eyes rolled wildly from side to side.</p>
<p>"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said the King. "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel
if she does not practice a good deal."</p>
<p>On which the Messenger, to Alice's great amusement, opened a bag that
hung round his neck, and handed a sandwich to the King, who devoured it
greedily.</p>
<p>"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody
better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own
partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother
Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was
sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he
did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses
on her, and very pretty they were." said the King.</p>
<p>"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you
really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than
marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?" the Messenger said, peeping into the
bag.</p>
<p>"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire." the King murmured in a faint whisper.</p>
<p>Alice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal. "_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie
more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his
life! It is admirable!" he remarked to her, as he munched
away.</p>
<p>"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," Alice
suggested: "and all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for."</p>
<p>"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure," the King replied. "How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly." Which Alice did not venture to deny.</p>
<p>"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be
idle, certainly might." the King went on, holding out his hand
to the Messenger for some more hay.</p>
<p>"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,
Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?" said the Messenger.</p>
<p>"Miss Bennet," said the King: "you ought to
know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved
on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you."</p>
<p>"I often think," the Messenger said in a sulky tone. "that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them."</p>
<p>"But what," said the King, "can have been his motive? What can
have induced him to behave so cruelly?"</p>
<p>"That would be a good scheme," said the Messenger, putting his hands to his mouth
in the shape of a trumpet, and stooping so as to get close to the King's
ear. Alice was sorry for this, as she wanted to hear the news too.
However, instead of whispering, he simply shouted at the top of his
voice "if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home."</p>
<p>"I am astonished, my dear," cried the poor King, jumping up and
shaking himself. "that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly
of anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however."</p>
<p>"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman," thought Alice. "He seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again." she ventured to ask.</p>
<p>"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She
is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.
Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the
case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she
is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion
that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble
in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and
I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead
of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend." said the King.</p>
<p>"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little."</p>
<p>"You are uniformly charming!" said the King: "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable." And they trotted
off, Alice repeating to herself, as she ran, the words of the old
song:--</p>
<p><br/>
   "Write to me very often, my dear."</p>
<p>
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five
grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty." she asked, as well as she
could, for the run was putting her quite out of breath.</p>
<p>"Miss Bingley told me," said the King. "that he never speaks much,
unless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable."</p>
<p>"I should not be surprised," Alice panted out, after running a little
further, "if he were to give it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers."</p>
<p>"From what we have seen of him," the King said, "I really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he
speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would
not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the
good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal
master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every
virtue."</p>
<p>Alice had no more breath for talking, so they trotted on in silence,
till they came in sight of a great crowd, in the middle of which the
Lion and Unicorn were fighting. They were in such a cloud of dust, that
at first Alice could not make out which was which: but she soon managed
to distinguish the Unicorn by his horn.</p>
<p>They placed themselves close to where Hatta, the other messenger, was
standing watching the fight, with a cup of tea in one hand and a piece
of bread-and-butter in the other.</p>
<p>"I admire the activity of your benevolence," Haigha whispered to Alice: "but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required." he went on, putting his arm affectionately round
Hatta's neck.</p>
<p>Hatta looked round and nodded, and went on with his bread and butter.</p>
<p>"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly
did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;
but I hope this may be false." said Haigha.</p>
<p>Hatta looked round once more, and this time a tear or two trickled down
his cheek: but not a word would he say.</p>
<p>"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one
false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in
her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex." Haigha cried impatiently. But Hatta only munched
away, and drank some more tea.</p>
<p>"I am not going to run away, papa," cried the King. "If I should
ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."</p>
<p>Hatta made a desperate effort, and swallowed a large piece of
bread-and-butter. "Could I expect it to be otherwise!" he said in a choking
voice: "Yet why did he come?"</p>
<p>"That will do
extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other
young ladies have time to exhibit." Alice
ventured to remark.</p>
<p>"Insolent girl!" said Hatta: "You are much mistaken
if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.
Darcy."</p>
<p>There was a pause in the fight just then, and the Lion and the Unicorn
sat down, panting, while the King called out "I will make no promise of the kind." Haigha and Hatta set to work at once, carrying rough
trays of white and brown bread. Alice took a piece to taste, but it was
VERY dry.</p>
<p>"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," the King said to Hatta:
"will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence." And Hatta went bounding away like a
grasshopper.</p>
<p>For a minute or two Alice stood silent, watching him. Suddenly she
brightened up. "I am sure," she cried, pointing eagerly. "if it was not for such good friends I do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers
a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are
nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a
charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the
country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it
in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease."</p>
<p>"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia," the King said, without even
looking round. "Though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."</p>
<p>"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says
that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks
the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many
accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies." Alice asked, very much
surprised at his taking it so quietly.</p>
<p>"Aye, so it is," said the King. "and Mrs. Long does not come back
till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself." he repeated softly to
himself, as he opened his memorandum-book. "When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known what
I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
much. Wretched, wretched mistake!"</p>
<p>At this moment the Unicorn sauntered by them, with his hands in his
pockets. "Do you not want to know who has taken it?" he said to the King, just
glancing at him as he passed.</p>
<p>"Nay," the King replied, rather nervously. "this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,
I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to show off before the ladies."</p>
<p>"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world." the Unicorn said carelessly, and he was going
on, when his eye happened to fall upon Alice: he turned round rather
instantly, and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the
deepest disgust.</p>
<p>"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise." he said at last.</p>
<p>"Lizzy," Haigha replied eagerly, coming in front of Alice
to introduce her, and spreading out both his hands towards her in an
Anglo-Saxon attitude. "I was going to look for you; come into my room."</p>
<p>"And they are really to be married!" said the Unicorn. "How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be
thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!"</p>
<p>"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other
neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I
dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been
the case?" said Haigha, solemnly.</p>
<p>The Unicorn looked dreamily at Alice, and said "Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am
no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is
such a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his
late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are
you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"</p>
<p>Alice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began: "EDW. GARDINER."</p>
<p>"To Jane herself," said the Unicorn, "there could be no possibility of
objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither
could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and
respectability which he will probably never reach."</p>
<p>"I should not mind anything at all." said Alice.</p>
<p>"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," the Unicorn went on, turning
from her to the King. "and
I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?"</p>
<p>"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," the King muttered, and beckoned to Haigha. "she times
them ill." he whispered. "Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion."</p>
<p>Haigha took a large cake out of the bag, and gave it to Alice to hold,
while he got out a dish and carving-knife. How they all came out of it
Alice couldn't guess. It was just like a conjuring-trick, she thought.</p>
<p>The Lion had joined them while this was going on: he looked very
tired and sleepy, and his eyes were half shut. "Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is
engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?" he said,
blinking lazily at Alice, and speaking in a deep hollow tone that
sounded like the tolling of a great bell.</p>
<p>"Oh! certainly," the Unicorn cried eagerly. "we will
ask you no questions."</p>
<p>The Lion looked at Alice wearily. "I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or
rather taller." he said, yawning at every other word.</p>
<p>"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's
connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday." the Unicorn cried out, before Alice could
reply.</p>
<p>"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," the Lion said, lying down and
putting his chin on this paws. "your
representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the
foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving
herself." (to the King
and the Unicorn): "I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is
all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking
to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to
inconvenience."</p>
<p>The King was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down between
the two great creatures; but there was no other place for him.</p>
<p>"I am sick of Mr. Bingley," the Unicorn said,
looking slyly up at the crown, which the poor King was nearly shaking
off his head, he trembled so much.</p>
<p>"I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it
ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be
done directly." said the Lion.</p>
<p>"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced
only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain
knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a
partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact." said the Unicorn.</p>
<p>"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" the Lion replied
angrily, half getting up as he spoke.</p>
<p>Here the King interrupted, to prevent the quarrel going on: he was very
nervous, and his voice quite quivered. "Well, well," he
said. "do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good
girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
them."</p>
<p>"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," the Lion growled out as he lay down again.
"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as I often see done."</p>
<p>Alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook, with the great
dish on her knees, and was sawing away diligently with the knife. "Oh! shocking!" she said, in reply to the Lion (she was getting quite
used to being called "I never heard anything so
abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?"). "Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected
you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There
can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight."</p>
<p>"Lizzy," the Unicorn
remarked. "what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?"</p>
<p>This sounded nonsense, but Alice very obediently got up, and carried the
dish round, and the cake divided itself into three pieces as she did so.
"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern
which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more
gentlemanlike manner." said the Lion, as she returned to her place with the
empty dish.</p>
<p>"_That_ is a failing indeed!" cried the Unicorn, as Alice sat with the knife
in her hand, very much puzzled how to begin. "Implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I
really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me."</p>
<p>"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear," said the Lion. "you
will wait on him of course."</p>
<p>But before Alice could answer him, the drums began.</p>
<p>Where the noise came from, she couldn't make out: the air seemed full
of it, and it rang through and through her head till she felt quite
deafened. She started to her feet and sprang across the little brook in
her terror,</p>
<p>  *    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>  *    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>and had just time to see the Lion and the Unicorn rise to their feet,
with angry looks at being interrupted in their feast, before she dropped
to her knees, and put her hands over her ears, vainly trying to shut out
the dreadful uproar.</p>
<p>"That is not an unnatural surmise," she thought to herself,
"but it is a
lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."</p>
<p></p>
<p>
CHAPTER VIII. "I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady."</p>
<p>After a while the noise seemed gradually to die away, till all was dead
silence, and Alice lifted up her head in some alarm. There was no one
to be seen, and her first thought was that she must have been dreaming
about the Lion and the Unicorn and those queer Anglo-Saxon Messengers.
However, there was the great dish still lying at her feet, on which she
had tried to cut the plum-cake, "I am afraid, Mr. Darcy," she
said to herself, "that
this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes." she went on in a rather complaining tone:
"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me
to determine."</p>
<p>At this moment her thoughts were interrupted by a loud shouting of
"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you." and a Knight dressed in crimson armour came
galloping down upon her, brandishing a great club. Just as he reached
her, the horse stopped suddenly: "Come here, my love, I want to
speak to you," the Knight cried,
as he tumbled off his horse.</p>
<p>Startled as she was, Alice was more frightened for him than for herself
at the moment, and watched him with some anxiety as he mounted again.
As soon as he was comfortably in the saddle, he began once more "My fingers," but here another voice broke in "do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the
trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman's of superior execution." and Alice
looked round in some surprise for the new enemy.</p>
<p>This time it was a White Knight. He drew up at Alice's side, and tumbled
off his horse just as the Red Knight had done: then he got on again,
and the two Knights sat and looked at each other for some time without
speaking. Alice looked from one to the other in some bewilderment.</p>
<p>"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would
have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so
pleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my
dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I
hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing
that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted." the Red Knight said at last.</p>
<p>"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins." the White Knight replied.</p>
<p>"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.
_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the
subject. This will never do." said the Red Knight, as he took up
his helmet (which hung from the saddle, and was something the shape of a
horse's head), and put it on.</p>
<p>"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So
genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_
is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter." the White Knight
remarked, putting on his helmet too.</p>
<p>"And Lydia used to want to go to London," said the Red Knight, and they began banging away at each
other with such fury that Alice got behind a tree to be out of the way
of the blows.</p>
<p>"You are a good girl;" she said to herself, as
she watched the fight, timidly peeping out from her hiding-place: "and I have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your
doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income."</p>
<p>Another Rule of Battle, that Alice had not noticed, seemed to be that
they always fell on their heads, and the battle ended with their both
falling off in this way, side by side: when they got up again, they
shook hands, and then the Red Knight mounted and galloped off.</p>
<p>"I am not one-and-twenty." said the White Knight, as he
came up panting.</p>
<p>"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," Alice said doubtfully. "You either choose this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be
completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire."</p>
<p>"In point of composition," said the White
Knight. "the letter does not seem
defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed."</p>
<p>"Not at all," said Alice. "but depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing
about it." It was evidently more than he could manage by himself; however,
she managed to shake him out of it at last.</p>
<p>"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes
me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin." said the Knight, putting back his
shaggy hair with both hands, and turning his gentle face and large mild
eyes to Alice. She thought she had never seen such a strange-looking
soldier in all her life.</p>
<p>He was dressed in tin armour, which seemed to fit him very badly, and
he had a queer-shaped little deal box fastened across his shoulder,
upside-down, and with the lid hanging open. Alice looked at it with
great curiosity.</p>
<p>"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that
gentleman," the Knight said in a friendly
tone. "seemed to think the country was nothing
at all."</p>
<p>"Well, mamma," Alice gently remarked. "and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I
am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half
my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get
husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."</p>
<p>"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," the Knight said, a shade of vexation passing over
his face. "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life." He unfastened it as he spoke, and was just going to
throw it into the bushes, when a sudden thought seemed to strike him,
and he hung it carefully on a tree. "Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates." he
said to Alice.</p>
<p>Alice shook her head.</p>
<p>"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I
did not expect such a compliment."</p>
<p>"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not
want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is
a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His
pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something
for fortune and figure." said Alice.</p>
<p>"I thank you for my share of the favour," the Knight said in a discontented
tone, "but I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands."</p>
<p>"My dear sir," said Alice. "I am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."</p>
<p>"Only think of its being three months," said the Knight: "since I went away;
it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure
I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I
thought it would be very good fun if I was."</p>
<p>"Are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" he went on after a pause, "I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her."</p>
<p>"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good," Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.</p>
<p>"Perhaps," the Knight replied. "I should have judged better, had I sought an
introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers."</p>
<p>"Is he married or single?" said Alice.</p>
<p>"I wish I could say anything to comfort you," the Knight said. "but it
is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction
of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have
always so much."</p>
<p>This took a very long time to manage, though Alice held the bag open
very carefully, because the Knight was so VERY awkward in putting in
the dish: the first two or three times that he tried he fell in himself
instead. "Yes," he said, as they got it in
a last; "but _that_
was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance." And he hung it
to the saddle, which was already loaded with bunches of carrots, and
fire-irons, and many other things.</p>
<p>"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let
us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one
mind." he continued, as they
set off.</p>
<p>"I am sure I shall break _mine_," Alice said, smiling.</p>
<p>"Do not give way to useless alarm," he said, anxiously. "though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we
may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make
him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done."</p>
<p>"I have, sir."
Alice enquired.</p>
<p>"Which do you mean?" said the Knight. "She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."</p>
<p>"I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?"</p>
<p>"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said the Knight. "to send for the
horses?"</p>
<p>It didn't sound a comfortable plan, Alice thought, and for a few minutes
she walked on in silence, puzzling over the idea, and every now and then
stopping to help the poor Knight, who certainly was NOT a good rider.</p>
<p>Whenever the horse stopped (which it did very often), he fell off in
front; and whenever it went on again (which it generally did rather
suddenly), he fell off behind. Otherwise he kept on pretty well, except
that he had a habit of now and then falling off sideways; and as he
generally did this on the side on which Alice was walking, she soon
found that it was the best plan not to walk QUITE close to the horse.</p>
<p>"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses." she ventured to
say, as she was helping him up from his fifth tumble.</p>
<p>The Knight looked very much surprised, and a little offended at the
remark. "It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far." he asked, as he scrambled back into
the saddle, keeping hold of Alice's hair with one hand, to save himself
from falling over on the other side.</p>
<p>"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours
when Miss de Bourgh comes in."</p>
<p>"What is all settled?" the Knight said very gravely: "And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!"</p>
<p>Alice could think of nothing better to say than "If your master would marry, you might see more of him." but she said
it as heartily as she could. They went on a little way in silence after
this, the Knight with his eyes shut, muttering to himself, and Alice
watching anxiously for the next tumble.</p>
<p>"My object then," the Knight suddenly began in a loud voice,
waving his right arm as he spoke, "was to show you, by every civility in
my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to
obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes
introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an
hour after I had seen you." Here the sentence ended
as suddenly as it had begun, as the Knight fell heavily on the top of
his head exactly in the path where Alice was walking. She was quite
frightened this time, and said in an anxious tone, as she picked him up,
"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,"</p>
<p>"He has made me so happy," the Knight said, as if he didn't mind breaking two
or three of them. "by telling me that he
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed
it possible."</p>
<p>He let go the bridle, and stretched out both his arms to show Alice
what he meant, and this time he fell flat on his back, right under the
horse's feet.</p>
<p>"You may depend upon it, Madam," he went on repeating, all the time that Alice was
getting him on his feet again. "that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she
remains with us."</p>
<p>"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are." cried Alice, losing all her patience this time.
"Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.
Collins."</p>
<p>"What should not you mind?" the Knight asked in a tone of great
interest, clasping his arms round the horse's neck as he spoke, just in
time to save himself from tumbling off again.</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly;" Alice said, with a little scream
of laughter, in spite of all she could do to prevent it.</p>
<p>"True," the Knight said thoughtfully to himself. "but it is a comfort to think that whatever of
that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make
the most of it."</p>
<p>There was a short silence after this, and then the Knight went on again.
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."</p>
<p>"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you
are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make
Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you
do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_." said Alice.</p>
<p>"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;
do we?"</p>
<p>"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,
and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy." Alice said politely.</p>
<p>"I have no reason, I assure you," said the Knight. "to be dissatisfied with my
reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very
handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."</p>
<p>"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy," Alice said
thoughtfully: "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an
affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what
I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in
the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."</p>
<p>"I must go instantly to my mother;" the Knight said, gravely: "I would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family! how shall I bear so much happiness!"</p>
<p>He looked so vexed at the idea, that Alice changed the subject hastily.
"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," she said cheerfully. "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.
Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of
both gentlemen as I did before."</p>
<p>The Knight looked down proudly at his helmet, which hung from the
saddle. "It keeps him in good
humour," he said, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express."</p>
<p>The knight looked so solemn about it that Alice did not dare to laugh.
"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design," she said in a trembling voice,
"but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business."</p>
<p>"I know little of the game at present," the Knight said, very seriously. "but I shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation in life--"</p>
<p>"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do." Alice objected.</p>
<p>The Knight shook his head. "If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
what to think." he said. He raised his hands in some excitement as he said
this, and instantly rolled out of the saddle, and fell headlong into a
deep ditch.</p>
<p>Alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him. She was rather
startled by the fall, as for some time he had kept on very well, and she
was afraid that he really WAS hurt this time. However, though she could
see nothing but the soles of his feet, she was much relieved to hear
that he was talking on in his usual tone. "I am exceedingly gratified,"
he repeated: "by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a
circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could."</p>
<p>"You have a very small park here," Alice asked, as
she dragged him out by the feet, and laid him in a heap on the bank.</p>
<p>The Knight looked surprised at the question. "The first wish of my heart," he said. "is never more to
be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
one or the other again!"</p>
<p>"No," he went on after
a pause, "I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch
for. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for the
convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others
so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings
are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper
would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost
forever."</p>
<p>"But you--how are you?" said Alice. "You look pale. How much you
must have gone through!" the Knight said in a slow thoughtful tone: "Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed."</p>
<p>"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very
superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the
first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at
her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then
flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You
will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that
young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."</p>
<p>"Oh! where, where is my uncle?" the Knight repeated as before: "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find
Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not
an instant to lose." he went on, holding his head down, and his voice getting
lower and lower, "Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."</p>
<p>"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,
you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind." Alice asked, hoping to cheer him
up, for the poor Knight seemed quite low-spirited about it.</p>
<p>"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If
he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will
think no more about him." the Knight answered with a groan.</p>
<p>"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."</p>
<p>"If you mean Darcy," he interrupted, quite eagerly: "he may go to bed, if he
chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled
thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send
round my cards." They had just
come to the end of the wood.</p>
<p>Alice could only look puzzled: she was thinking of the pudding.</p>
<p>"And that," the Knight said in an anxious tone: "is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago."</p>
<p>"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,
because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an
unpleasant thing." Alice asked, for she had heard a good deal of poetry
that day.</p>
<p>"I do, I do like him," said the Knight, "I love him.
Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms."</p>
<p>"A man who had felt less, might." said Alice, for the Knight had made a sudden pause.</p>
<p>"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never
happened to see her there?"
EYES."'</p>
<p>"If one could but go to Brighton!" Alice said, trying to feel
interested.</p>
<p>"Money! My uncle!" the Knight said, looking a little vexed.
"what do you mean, sir?"</p>
<p>"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?" Alice
corrected herself.</p>
<p>"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my
good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
offending your patroness."</p>
<p>"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said Alice, who was by this time
completely bewildered.</p>
<p>"So, Lizzy," the Knight said. "your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.
It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction
among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to
be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham
be _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."</p>
<p>So saying, he stopped his horse and let the reins fall on its neck:
then, slowly beating time with one hand, and with a faint smile lighting
up his gentle foolish face, as if he enjoyed the music of his song, he
began.</p>
<p>Of all the strange things that Alice saw in her journey Through The
Looking-Glass, this was the one that she always remembered most clearly.
Years afterwards she could bring the whole scene back again, as if it
had been only yesterday--the mild blue eyes and kindly smile of the
Knight--the setting sun gleaming through his hair, and shining on his
armour in a blaze of light that quite dazzled her--the horse quietly
moving about, with the reins hanging loose on his neck, cropping the
grass at her feet--and the black shadows of the forest behind--all this
she took in like a picture, as, with one hand shading her eyes, she
leant against a tree, watching the strange pair, and listening, in a
half dream, to the melancholy music of the song.</p>
<p>"Yes, very indifferent indeed," she said to herself: "Oh, Jane,
take care." She stood and listened very attentively,
but no tears came into her eyes.</p>
<p><br/>
     'I'll tell thee everything I can;<br/>
      There's little to relate.<br/>
     I saw an aged aged man,<br/>
      A-sitting on a gate.<br/>
     "Who are you, aged man?" I said,<br/>
      "and how is it you live?"<br/>
     And his answer trickled through my head<br/>
      Like water through a sieve.</p>
<p>     He said "I look for butterflies<br/>
      That sleep among the wheat:<br/>
     I make them into mutton-pies,<br/>
      And sell them in the street.<br/>
     I sell them unto men," he said,<br/>
      "Who sail on stormy seas;<br/>
     And that's the way I get my bread--<br/>
      A trifle, if you please."</p>
<p>     But I was thinking of a plan<br/>
      To dye one's whiskers green,<br/>
     And always use so large a fan<br/>
      That they could not be seen.<br/>
     So, having no reply to give<br/>
      To what the old man said,<br/>
     I cried, "Come, tell me how you live!"<br/>
      And thumped him on the head.</p>
<p>     His accents mild took up the tale:<br/>
      He said "I go my ways,<br/>
     And when I find a mountain-rill,<br/>
      I set it in a blaze;<br/>
     And thence they make a stuff they call<br/>
      Rolands' Macassar Oil--<br/>
     Yet twopence-halfpenny is all<br/>
      They give me for my toil."</p>
<p>     But I was thinking of a way<br/>
      To feed oneself on batter,<br/>
     And so go on from day to day<br/>
      Getting a little fatter.<br/>
     I shook him well from side to side,<br/>
      Until his face was blue:<br/>
     "Come, tell me how you live," I cried,<br/>
      "And what it is you do!"</p>
<p>     He said "I hunt for haddocks' eyes<br/>
      Among the heather bright,<br/>
     And work them into waistcoat-buttons<br/>
      In the silent night.<br/>
     And these I do not sell for gold<br/>
      Or coin of silvery shine<br/>
     But for a copper halfpenny,<br/>
      And that will purchase nine.</p>
<p>     "I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,<br/>
      Or set limed twigs for crabs;<br/>
     I sometimes search the grassy knolls<br/>
      For wheels of Hansom-cabs.<br/>
     And that's the way" (he gave a wink)<br/>
      "By which I get my wealth--<br/>
     And very gladly will I drink<br/>
      Your Honour's noble health."</p>
<p>     I heard him then, for I had just<br/>
      Completed my design<br/>
     To keep the Menai bridge from rust<br/>
      By boiling it in wine.<br/>
     I thanked him much for telling me<br/>
      The way he got his wealth,<br/>
     But chiefly for his wish that he<br/>
      Might drink my noble health.</p>
<p>     And now, if e'er by chance I put<br/>
      My fingers into glue<br/>
     Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot<br/>
      Into a left-hand shoe,<br/>
     Or if I drop upon my toe<br/>
      A very heavy weight,<br/>
     I weep, for it reminds me so,<br/>
      Of that old man I used to know--</p>
<p>     Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow,<br/>
     Whose hair was whiter than the snow,<br/>
     Whose face was very like a crow,<br/>
     With eyes, like cinders, all aglow,<br/>
     Who seemed distracted with his woe,<br/>
     Who rocked his body to and fro,<br/>
     And muttered mumblingly and low,<br/>
     As if his mouth were full of dough,<br/>
     Who snorted like a buffalo--<br/>
     That summer evening, long ago,<br/>
      A-sitting on a gate.'</p>
<p>
As the Knight sang the last words of the ballad, he gathered up the
reins, and turned his horse's head along the road by which they had
come. "Oh! Mary," he said, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there
was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty
had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved
very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold
luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated
you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never
should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then
we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that
anybody might have heard us ten miles off!" he added as Alice turned with an eager look in the
direction to which he pointed. "Indeed I do not dare."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Alice: "_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed,
and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!"</p>
<p>"And this," the Knight said doubtfully: "is the end of all his friend's anxious
circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"</p>
<p>So they shook hands, and then the Knight rode slowly away into the
forest. "But my dear Elizabeth," Alice said to
herself, as she stood watching him. "what sort of girl is Miss King? I
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary." So she went on talking to herself,
as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road, and the
Knight tumbling off, first on one side and then on the other. After
the fourth or fifth tumble he reached the turn, and then she waved her
handkerchief to him, and waited till he was out of sight.</p>
<p>"Well, Lizzy," she said, as she turned to run down the
hill: "what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But
I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is
a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there's the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of
his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of
everybody, too, who is likely to know." A very few steps brought her to the edge of the brook. "I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party." she cried as she bounded across,</p>
<p>  *    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>  *    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>and threw herself down to rest on a lawn as soft as moss, with little
flower-beds dotted about it here and there. "Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look
well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone." she exclaimed in a tone of dismay,
as she put her hands up to something very heavy, and fitted tight all
round her head.</p>
<p>"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He
arranges the business just as he pleases." she said to
herself, as she lifted it off, and set it on her lap to make out what it
could possibly be.</p>
<p>It was a golden crown.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
CHAPTER IX. Queen Alice</p>
<p>"My dear Jane!" said Alice. "you are too good. Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say
to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve." she went on in
a severe tone (she was always rather fond of scolding herself), "Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected
mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the
purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as
soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of
my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design
of selecting a wife, as I certainly did."</p>
<p>So she got up and walked about--rather stiffly just at first, as she was
afraid that the crown might come off: but she comforted herself with the
thought that there was nobody to see her, "Certainly,"
she said as she sat down again, "there are such people, but I hope I
am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.
Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,
and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely
what you are without."</p>
<p>Everything was happening so oddly that she didn't feel a bit surprised
at finding the Red Queen and the White Queen sitting close to her, one
on each side: she would have liked very much to ask them how they came
there, but she feared it would not be quite civil. However, there would
be no harm, she thought, in asking if the game was over. "Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last." she began, looking timidly at the Red Queen.</p>
<p>"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.
We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we
are to talk of next I cannot imagine." The Queen sharply interrupted her.</p>
<p>"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," said Alice, who was always ready
for a little argument, "I am
_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."</p>
<p>"I do not cough for my own amusement," cried the Queen. "When is
your next ball to be, Lizzy?" here she
broke off with a frown, and, after thinking for a minute, suddenly
changed the subject of the conversation. "I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend
pens remarkably well."</p>
<p>"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as
Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large." poor Alice pleaded in a piteous tone.</p>
<p>The two Queens looked at each other, and the Red Queen remarked, with a
little shudder, "I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is
very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so
much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen
almost took from me my faculties."</p>
<p>"My aunt," the White Queen moaned,
wringing her hands. "is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street."</p>
<p>"I can answer your question," the Red Queen said to Alice. "without applying to
him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble."</p>
<p>"What, none of you?" Alice was beginning, but the Red Queen
interrupted her impatiently.</p>
<p>"I never heard that it was."</p>
<p>"Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps." Alice objected.</p>
<p>"Next time you call," said the Red Queen. "I hope we shall be more lucky."</p>
<p>"Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said the White Queen, "must disarm reproof."</p>
<p>"How should you have liked making sermons?" the Red Queen remarked; and then there was an
uncomfortable silence for a minute or two.</p>
<p>The Red Queen broke the silence by saying to the White Queen, "You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so
oddly."</p>
<p>The White Queen smiled feebly, and said "You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone
to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
It will pass away soon enough."</p>
<p>"It _is_ wonderful," said Alice; "for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has
connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are
none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
impulses even than pride."</p>
<p>"Not at all," the Red Queen remarked: "they were brightened by the exercise."</p>
<p>"And so ended his affection," said Alice. "There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"</p>
<p>"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.
But," the White Queen asked. "as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case."</p>
<p>"I confess," said Alice. "that I should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
(an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately
after your arrival!"</p>
<p>"If he does not come to me, _then_," the Red Queen interrupted. "I shall give him up for
ever."</p>
<p>"They have both," Alice replied very readily: "been deceived, I dare say, in some way
or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side."</p>
<p>"We have not determined how far it shall carry us," said the White Queen. "but, perhaps, to the Lakes."</p>
<p>"Then," Alice was beginning, but the Red Queen answered for her.
"you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman."</p>
<p>Alice considered. "I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me."</p>
<p>"I should imagine not." said the Red Queen.</p>
<p>"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!"</p>
<p>"He likes to have his own way very well," said the Red Queen: "But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it
than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak
feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence."</p>
<p>"I have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."</p>
<p>"Come, Darcy," the Red Queen cried. "I must have you dance. I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
dance."</p>
<p>"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not
of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our
importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness
of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger
Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?" Alice replied cautiously.</p>
<p>"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?" the Queen
exclaimed triumphantly.</p>
<p>Alice said, as gravely as she could, "If he had had any compassion for _me_," But
she couldn't help thinking to herself, "he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of
his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!"</p>
<p>"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?" the Queens said together, with great
emphasis.</p>
<p>"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain
it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was
of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and
I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can
recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort
of men, and that he hates me." Alice said, turning suddenly on the White Queen, for
she didn't like being found fault with so much.</p>
<p>The Queen gasped and shut her eyes. "But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge?"</p>
<p>"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other
several times. I wonder what he can be doing there." said the Red Queen.</p>
<p>"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of
innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude
which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish
being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I
was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I
was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt
by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all
that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught
me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family
circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least
to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I
was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been
but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You
taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you,
I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.
You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman
worthy of being pleased." said Alice.</p>
<p>"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" the White Queen whispered: "Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,
Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read
great books and make extracts."</p>
<p>Here the Red Queen began again. "But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," she
said. "Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him
at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off
his grounds."</p>
<p>"Well, Lizzy," Alice cried eagerly. "and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope
it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an
excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her
mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, I dare say."</p>
<p>"Miss Bingley," the White Queen asked. "has given me more credit than can be.
The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their
actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in
life is a joke."</p>
<p>"Your plan is a good one," Alice explained: "where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But
these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,
she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its
reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character."</p>
<p>"It may perhaps be pleasant," said the White Queen. "to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in
the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_
affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."</p>
<p>"You have only proved by this," the Red Queen anxiously interrupted. "that Mr. Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much
more than he did himself." So they set to work and fanned her with bunches
of leaves, till she had to beg them to leave off, it blew her hair about
so.</p>
<p>"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said the Red Queen. "that ever
lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but
themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give
him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw
anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away
like other young men."</p>
<p>"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever." Alice replied gravely.</p>
<p>"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected." said the Red Queen.</p>
<p>Alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time. "Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?" she exclaimed triumphantly.</p>
<p>But the Red Queen drew herself up rather stiffly, and said "In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."</p>
<p>"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at
being spoke to." Alice thought to herself.</p>
<p>"And then," the White Queen said in an anxious tone. "if that very
improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to
tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"</p>
<p>"My dear, dear Lydia!" Alice said very decidedly, for she felt quite
certain about this, "This is delightful indeed! She will
be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!
My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage
everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the
clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about
them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him
how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear
Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!" she hastily corrected
herself. "Surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?"</p>
<p>"Oh!" said the Red Queen: "I am excessively diverted. But it is so
strange!"</p>
<p>"I am the less surprised at what has happened," the White Queen said, looking down and nervously
clasping and unclasping her hands, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."</p>
<p>Alice was puzzled. "You must decide for yourself," she remarked, "and if, upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
all means to refuse him."</p>
<p>The Red Queen said, "What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his
meaning?"</p>
<p>"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," Alice ventured to ask.</p>
<p>"I wish it may."</p>
<p>"She seems a very pleasant young woman."</p>
<p>"Well," cried the Red Queen. "it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children
must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have
ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy!
In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well
it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in
such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and
you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."</p>
<p>Alice sighed and gave it up. "My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her
better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been
entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister,
though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I
still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was
as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for
wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to
happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not
return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I
receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that
she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not
calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was
in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was
perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,
though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out
as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on
her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting
wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the
cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know
this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily
account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to
his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and
amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,
because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.
He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said
herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she
wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I
cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity
in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,
and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the
invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very
soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield
again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better
not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts
from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and
Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc." she thought.</p>
<p>"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," the White Queen went on in a low voice, more
as if she were talking to herself. "to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has
never seen the view."</p>
<p>"Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it
by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?" said the Red Queen.</p>
<p>"It is _not_ Mr. Bingley," the White Queen went on, "it is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life."</p>
<p>"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that
his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood." Alice asked in an astonished tone.</p>
<p>"True. Are the others coming out?" said the Queen.</p>
<p>"'Tis too much!" said Alice: "by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!
why is not everybody as happy?"</p>
<p>Here the White Queen began again. "Oh! certainly," ("no one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides
all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half-deserved." said the Red Queen.) "Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study
of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule."</p>
<p>Alice thought to herself, "You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as
these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself." but she did not
say this aloud, for fear of hurting the poor Queen's feeling.</p>
<p>"Indeed," the Red Queen said to Alice, taking
one of the White Queen's hands in her own, and gently stroking it:
"I am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"</p>
<p>The White Queen looked timidly at Alice, who felt she OUGHT to say
something kind, but really couldn't think of anything at the moment.</p>
<p>"But you forget, mamma," the Red Queen went on: "that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him." But this was more than Alice had courage to do.</p>
<p>"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London."</p>
<p>The White Queen gave a deep sigh, and laid her head on Alice's shoulder.
"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!" she moaned.</p>
<p>"And this is always the way with him," said the Red Queen. "Whatever
can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There
is nothing he would not do for her."</p>
<p>"But you see that Jane," said Alice, as she tried to obey the
first direction: "does not think so very ill of
Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt."</p>
<p>"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance." said the Red Queen, and she began:</p>
<p><br/>
   'Hush-a-by lady, in Alice's lap!<br/>
   Till the feast's ready, we've time for a nap:<br/>
   When the feast's over, we'll go to the ball--<br/>
   Red Queen, and White Queen, and Alice, and all!</p>
<p>
"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening," she added, as she put her head down on
Alice's other shoulder, "The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved
in civility." In another moment both Queens were fast asleep, and snoring loud.</p>
<p>"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken," exclaimed Alice, looking about in great perplexity,
as first one round head, and then the other, rolled down from her
shoulder, and lay like a heavy lump in her lap. "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,
which you must acknowledge to be true." she went on in an impatient tone; but there was no answer
but a gentle snoring.</p>
<p>The snoring got more distinct every minute, and sounded more like a
tune: at last she could even make out the words, and she listened so
eagerly that, when the two great heads vanished from her lap, she hardly
missed them.</p>
<p>She was standing before an arched doorway over which were the words
QUEEN ALICE in large letters, and on each side of the arch there was a
bell-handle; one was marked "These are heavy misfortunes," Bell,"But the wife of Mr.
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine."
Bell.'</p>
<p>"As I did the other day," thought Alice, "very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine
that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my
honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope
you are satisfied." she went on, very much puzzled by
the names. "Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland."</p>
<p>Just then the door opened a little way, and a creature with a long beak
put its head out for a moment and said "I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it
everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the
good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing
of the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters,
too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his." and shut the door again with a bang.</p>
<p>Alice knocked and rang in vain for a long time, but at last, a very old
Frog, who was sitting under a tree, got up and hobbled slowly towards
her: he was dressed in bright yellow, and had enormous boots on.</p>
<p>"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our
original plan." the Frog said in a deep hoarse whisper.</p>
<p>Alice turned round, ready to find fault with anybody. "I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces
of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
of her." she began angrily.</p>
<p>"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a
finer county in England than Derbyshire." said the Frog.</p>
<p>Alice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which he
spoke. "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,
for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the
truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.
But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your
fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the
subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you
cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a
great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again,
for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your
idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I
am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so
before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she
only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that
he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.
Yours, etc."</p>
<p>The Frog looked at the door with his large dull eyes for a minute:
then he went nearer and rubbed it with his thumb, as if he were trying
whether the paint would come off; then he looked at Alice.</p>
<p>"Dining out," he said. "that is very unlucky." He was so
hoarse that Alice could scarcely hear him.</p>
<p>"As to
her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged." she said.</p>
<p>"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him," the Frog went on. "I have
never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever
since he was four years old."</p>
<p>"If I," Alice said impatiently. "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,
to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time
to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The
rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,
especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit
him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an
occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the
family."</p>
<p>"If you believed it impossible to be true," the Frog muttered. "I wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?" Then he went up and gave the door a kick with one of his
great feet. "With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady
energetic." he panted out, as he hobbled back to his
tree, "But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as
often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley's
love?"</p>
<p>At this moment the door was flung open, and a shrill voice was heard
singing:</p>
<p><br/>
   "I hope not."</p>
<p>
And hundreds of voices joined in the chorus:</p>
<p><br/>
  "He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,
we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a
partner?"</p>
<p>
Then followed a confused noise of cheering, and Alice thought to
herself, "This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and
I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am
in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are
engaged." In a minute there was silence again, and the same shrill
voice sang another verse;</p>
<p><br/>
  "Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your
accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?"</p>
<p>
Then came the chorus again:--</p>
<p><br/>
  "Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I
shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I
would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will
die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done."</p>
<p>
"What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?" Alice repeated in despair, "Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that
Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is
perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to
put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?" and there was a dead silence the
moment she appeared.</p>
<p>Alice glanced nervously along the table, as she walked up the large
hall, and noticed that there were about fifty guests, of all kinds: some
were animals, some birds, and there were even a few flowers among them.
"I did not think Caroline in spirits," she thought: "but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached
her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much
engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was
not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall
see them soon here."</p>
<p>There were three chairs at the head of the table; the Red and White
Queens had already taken two of them, but the middle one was empty.
Alice sat down in it, rather uncomfortable in the silence, and longing
for some one to speak.</p>
<p>At last the Red Queen began. "I am thinking of what you have been telling me," she
said. "Your
cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?" And the waiters set a leg of mutton before
Alice, who looked at it rather anxiously, as she had never had to carve
a joint before.</p>
<p>"I shall not say you are mistaken,"
said the Red Queen. "because you could not
really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have
had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find
great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are
not your own." The leg of mutton
got up in the dish and made a little bow to Alice; and Alice returned
the bow, not knowing whether to be frightened or amused.</p>
<p>"May I ask to what these questions tend?" she said, taking up the knife and fork, and
looking from one Queen to the other.</p>
<p>"Upon my word," the Red Queen said, very decidedly: "I begin to be of your uncle's
opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of
Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?" And the
waiters carried it off, and brought a large plum-pudding in its place.</p>
<p>"There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure," Alice said rather
hastily, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I
have seen nothing of it."</p>
<p>But the Red Queen looked sulky, and growled "Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is
good enough for him." and the waiters took it away so
quickly that Alice couldn't return its bow.</p>
<p>However, she didn't see why the Red Queen should be the only one to give
orders, so, as an experiment, she called out "Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you." and there it was again in a moment like a conjuring-trick. It
was so large that she couldn't help feeling a LITTLE shy with it, as she
had been with the mutton; however, she conquered her shyness by a great
effort and cut a slice and handed it to the Red Queen.</p>
<p>"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," said the Pudding. "but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to
Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay
I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have
heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves."</p>
<p>It spoke in a thick, suety sort of voice, and Alice hadn't a word to say
in reply: she could only sit and look at it and gasp.</p>
<p>"Let me first see how he behaves," said the Red Queen: "it will then be early
enough for expectation."</p>
<p>"I dislike it very much,"
Alice began, a little frightened at finding that, the moment she opened
her lips, there was dead silence, and all eyes were fixed upon her; "but it must be done."</p>
<p>She spoke to the Red Queen, whose answer was a little wide of the mark.
"In the first place," she said, very slowly and solemnly, putting her mouth
close to Alice's ear, "there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to Scotland."</p>
<p>"I will go to Meryton," the White Queen murmured
into Alice's other ear, in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon. "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call
on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.
An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do
anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you
heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding."</p>
<p>"Oh! mamma, do the
people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;
and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he
should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took
off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that
he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything." Alice said very politely.</p>
<p>The White Queen laughed with delight, and stroked Alice's cheek. Then
she began:</p>
<p><br/>
    '"First, the fish must be caught."<br/>
  That is easy: a baby, I think, could have caught it.<br/>
    "Next, the fish must be bought."<br/>
  That is easy: a penny, I think, would have bought it.</p>
<p>    "Now cook me the fish!"<br/>
  That is easy, and will not take more than a minute.<br/>
    "Let it lie in a dish!"<br/>
  That is easy, because it already is in it.</p>
<p>    "Bring it here! Let me sup!"<br/>
  It is easy to set such a dish on the table.<br/>
    "Take the dish-cover up!"<br/>
  Ah, THAT is so hard that I fear I'm unable!</p>
<p>    For it holds it like glue--<br/>
  Holds the lid to the dish, while it lies in the middle:<br/>
    Which is easiest to do,<br/>
  Un-dish-cover the fish, or dishcover the riddle?'</p>
<p>
"No," said the Red Queen.
"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of
his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's,
Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has
been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard." she screamed
at the top of her voice, and all the guests began drinking it directly,
and very queerly they managed it: some of them put their glasses upon
their heads like extinguishers, and drank all that trickled down their
faces--others upset the decanters, and drank the wine as it ran off
the edges of the table--and three of them (who looked like kangaroos)
scrambled into the dish of roast mutton, and began eagerly lapping up
the gravy, "Yes I have had a letter from him by express." thought Alice.</p>
<p>"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
avenue." the Red Queen said,
frowning at Alice as she spoke.</p>
<p>"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly." the White Queen whispered, as Alice got
up to do it, very obediently, but a little frightened.</p>
<p>"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister," she whispered in reply, "Well, so much the better. Not
that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am
sure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome
to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?
But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"</p>
<p>"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon." the Red Queen said very decidedly:
so Alice tried to submit to it with a good grace.</p>
<p>("I should like balls infinitely better," she said afterwards, when she was telling her
sister the history of the feast. "if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of
the day.")</p>
<p>In fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while she
made her speech: the two Queens pushed her so, one on each side, that
they nearly lifted her up into the air: "No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For
my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;
_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,
I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend."
Alice began: and she really DID rise as she spoke, several inches; but
she got hold of the edge of the table, and managed to pull herself down
again.</p>
<p>"What is there of good to be expected?" screamed the White Queen, seizing Alice's hair
with both her hands. "But perhaps you would like to read it."</p>
<p>And then (as Alice afterwards described it) all sorts of things happened
in a moment. The candles all grew up to the ceiling, looking something
like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top. As to the bottles, they
each took a pair of plates, which they hastily fitted on as wings, and
so, with forks for legs, went fluttering about in all directions: "What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my
behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was
unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence." Alice thought to herself, as well as she
could in the dreadful confusion that was beginning.</p>
<p>At this moment she heard a hoarse laugh at her side, and turned to see
what was the matter with the White Queen; but, instead of the Queen,
there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair. "Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there
are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever
to pay him." cried a
voice from the soup tureen, and Alice turned again, just in time to see
the Queen's broad good-natured face grinning at her for a moment over
the edge of the tureen, before she disappeared into the soup.</p>
<p>There was not a moment to be lost. Already several of the guests were
lying down in the dishes, and the soup ladle was walking up the table
towards Alice's chair, and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of
its way.</p>
<p>"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?" she cried as she jumped up and seized
the table-cloth with both hands: one good pull, and plates, dishes,
guests, and candles came crashing down together in a heap on the floor.</p>
<p>"It is from Miss Bingley," she went on, turning fiercely upon the Red Queen, whom
she considered as the cause of all the mischief--but the Queen was no
longer at her side--she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a
little doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round and round
after her own shawl, which was trailing behind her.</p>
<p>At any other time, Alice would have felt surprised at this, but she was
far too much excited to be surprised at anything NOW. "Both,"
she repeated, catching hold of the little creature in the very act of
jumping over a bottle which had just lighted upon the table, "for I have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."</p>
<p></p>
<p>
CHAPTER X. Shaking</p>
<p>She took her off the table as she spoke, and shook her backwards and
forwards with all her might.</p>
<p>The Red Queen made no resistance whatever; only her face grew very
small, and her eyes got large and green: and still, as Alice went on
shaking her, she kept on growing shorter--and fatter--and softer--and
rounder--and--</p>
<p></p>
<p>
CHAPTER XI. Waking</p>
<p>--and it really WAS a kitten, after all.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
CHAPTER XII. Which Dreamed it?</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly," Alice said, rubbing her eyes, and
addressing the kitten, respectfully, yet with some severity. "there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable."</p>
<p>It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (Alice had once made the
remark) that, whatever you say to them, they ALWAYS purr. "I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," she had
said, "Wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as Jane's."</p>
<p>On this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible to guess
whether it meant "What you ask," or "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
Darcy had much better finish his letter."</p>
<p>So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the
Red Queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, and put
the kitten and the Queen to look at each other. "And may I ask--" she cried,
clapping her hands triumphantly. "but the terms, I suppose, must be
complied with."</p>
<p>("His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," she said, when she was explaining the
thing afterwards to her sister: "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he informed me himself.")</p>
<p>"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," Alice cried with a merry laugh.
"has very lately given him
a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long." And she caught it up and gave it one little kiss, "You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious
me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised
them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!" she went on, looking over her shoulder at the White
Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, 'when WILL
Dinah have finished with your White Majesty, I wonder? That must be the
reason you were so untidy in my dream--Dinah! do you know that you're
scrubbing a White Queen? Really, it's most disrespectful of you!</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make
haste, and come down this moment." she prattled on, as she settled
comfortably down, with one elbow in the rug, and her chin in her hand,
to watch the kittens. 'Tell me, Dinah, did you turn to Humpty Dumpty? I
THINK you did--however, you'd better not mention it to your friends just
yet, for I'm not sure.</p>
<p>'By the way, Kitty, if only you'd been really with me in my dream, there
was one thing you WOULD have enjoyed--I had such a quantity of poetry
said to me, all about fishes! To-morrow morning you shall have a real
treat. All the time you're eating your breakfast, I'll repeat "The
Walrus and the Carpenter" to you; and then you can make believe it's
oysters, dear!</p>
<p>"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for
himself." But the provoking kitten
only began on the other paw, and pretended it hadn't heard the question.</p>
<p>Which do YOU think it was?</p>
<p><br/>
              ----</p>
<p><br/>
         A boat beneath a sunny sky,<br/>
         Lingering onward dreamily<br/>
         In an evening of July--</p>
<p>         Children three that nestle near,<br/>
         Eager eye and willing ear,<br/>
         Pleased a simple tale to hear--</p>
<p>         Long has paled that sunny sky:<br/>
         Echoes fade and memories die.<br/>
         Autumn frosts have slain July.</p>
<p>         Still she haunts me, phantomwise,<br/>
         Alice moving under skies<br/>
         Never seen by waking eyes.</p>
<p>         Children yet, the tale to hear,<br/>
         Eager eye and willing ear,<br/>
         Lovingly shall nestle near.</p>
<p>         In a Wonderland they lie,<br/>
         Dreaming as the days go by,<br/>
         Dreaming as the summers die:</p>
<p>         Ever drifting down the stream--<br/>
         Lingering in the golden gleam--<br/>
         Life, what is it but a dream?</p>
<p><br/>
              THE END</p>
<p></p>

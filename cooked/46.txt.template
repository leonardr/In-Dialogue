May it haunt their houses\r\npleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.", "Their faithful Friend and Servant,\r\n                                   C. D.\r\nDecember, 1843.", "", "CONTENTS", "Stave   I: Marley's Ghost\r\nStave  II: The First of the Three Spirits\r\nStave III: The Second of the Three Spirits\r\nStave  IV: The Last of the Spirits\r\nStave   V: The End of It", "", "STAVE I:  MARLEY'S GHOST", "MARLEY was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt\r\nwhatever about that. The register of his burial was\r\nsigned by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,\r\nand the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and\r\nScrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he\r\nchose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a\r\ndoor-nail.", "Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my\r\nown knowledge, what there is particularly dead about\r\na door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to\r\nregard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery\r\nin the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors\r\nis in the simile; and my unhallowed hands\r\nshall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You\r\nwill therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that\r\nMarley was as dead as a door-nail.", "Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did.\r\nHow could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were\r\npartners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge\r\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole\r\nassign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and\r\nsole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully\r\ncut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent\r\nman of business on the very day of the funeral,\r\nand solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.", "The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to\r\nthe point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley\r\nwas dead. This must be distinctly understood, or\r\nnothing wonderful can come of the story I am going\r\nto relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that\r\nHamlet's Father died before the play began, there\r\nwould be nothing more remarkable in his taking a\r\nstroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\r\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged\r\ngentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy\r\nspot--say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance--\r\nliterally to astonish his son's weak mind.", "Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name.\r\nThere it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse\r\ndoor: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as\r\nScrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the\r\nbusiness called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,\r\nbut he answered to both names. It was all the\r\nsame to him.", "Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone,\r\nScrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,\r\nclutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint,\r\nfrom which no steel had ever struck out generous fire;\r\nsecret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The\r\ncold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed\r\nnose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his\r\neyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his\r\ngrating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his\r\neyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low\r\ntemperature always about with him; he iced his office in\r\nthe dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.", "External heat and cold had little influence on\r\nScrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather\r\nchill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he,\r\nno falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no\r\npelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't\r\nknow where to have him. The heaviest rain, and\r\nsnow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage\r\nover him in only one respect. They often %(dialogue)s\r\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.", "Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with\r\ngladsome looks, %(dialogue)s No beggars implored\r\nhim to bestow a trifle, no children asked him\r\nwhat it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all\r\nhis life inquired the way to such and such a place, of\r\nScrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to\r\nknow him; and when they saw him coming on, would\r\ntug their owners into doorways and up courts; and\r\nthen would wag their tails as though they said, %(dialogue)s", "But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing\r\nhe liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths\r\nof life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance,\r\nwas what the knowing ones call %(dialogue)s to Scrooge.", "Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year,\r\non Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his\r\ncounting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy\r\nwithal: and he could hear the people in the court outside,\r\ngo wheezing up and down, beating their hands\r\nupon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the\r\npavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had\r\nonly just gone three, but it was quite dark already--\r\nit had not been light all day--and candles were flaring\r\nin the windows of the neighbouring offices, like\r\nruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog\r\ncame pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was\r\nso dense without, that although the court was of the\r\nnarrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms.\r\nTo see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring\r\neverything, one might have thought that Nature\r\nlived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.", "The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open\r\nthat he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a\r\ndismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying\r\nletters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's\r\nfire was so very much smaller that it looked like one\r\ncoal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept\r\nthe coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the\r\nclerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted\r\nthat it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore\r\nthe clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to\r\nwarm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being\r\na man of a strong imagination, he failed.", "%(dialogue)s cried\r\na cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge's\r\nnephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was\r\nthe first intimation he had of his approach.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge, %(dialogue)s", "He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the\r\nfog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was\r\nall in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his\r\neyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge's\r\nnephew. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s returned the nephew gaily. %(dialogue)s", "Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur\r\nof the moment, said, %(dialogue)s again; and followed it up\r\nwith %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said the nephew.", "%(dialogue)s returned the uncle, %(dialogue)s said Scrooge indignantly, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s pleaded the nephew.", "%(dialogue)s returned the uncle sternly, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s repeated Scrooge's nephew. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s returned the nephew. %(dialogue)s", "The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded.\r\nBecoming immediately sensible of the impropriety,\r\nhe poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark\r\nfor ever.", "%(dialogue)s said\r\nScrooge, %(dialogue)s he added, turning to his nephew. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "Scrooge said that he would see him--yes, indeed he\r\ndid. He went the whole length of the expression,\r\nand said that he would see him in that extremity first.", "%(dialogue)s cried Scrooge's nephew. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s growled Scrooge, as if\r\nthat were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous\r\nthan a merry Christmas. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge.", "His nephew left the room without an angry word,\r\nnotwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to\r\nbestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who,\r\ncold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\r\nthem cordially.", "%(dialogue)s muttered Scrooge; who\r\noverheard him: %(dialogue)s", "This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had\r\nlet two other people in. They were portly gentlemen,\r\npleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off,\r\nin Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in\r\ntheir hands, and bowed to him.", "%(dialogue)s said one of the\r\ngentlemen, referring to his list. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s\r\nScrooge replied. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said the gentleman, presenting\r\nhis credentials.", "It certainly was; for they had been two kindred\r\nspirits. At the ominous word %(dialogue)s Scrooge\r\nfrowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials\r\nback.", "%(dialogue)s\r\nsaid the gentleman, taking up a pen, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s asked Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s said the gentleman, laying down\r\nthe pen again.", "%(dialogue)s demanded Scrooge.\r\n%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s returned the gentleman, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s\r\nreturned the gentleman, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s Scrooge replied.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s observed the gentleman.", "%(dialogue)s Scrooge returned. %(dialogue)s", "Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue\r\ntheir point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed\r\nhis labours with an improved opinion of himself,\r\nand in a more facetious temper than was usual\r\nwith him.", "Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that\r\npeople ran about with flaring links, proffering their\r\nservices to go before horses in carriages, and conduct\r\nthem on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\r\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down\r\nat Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became\r\ninvisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the\r\nclouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if\r\nits teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there.\r\nThe cold became intense. In the main street, at the\r\ncorner of the court, some labourers were repairing\r\nthe gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\r\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were\r\ngathered: warming their hands and winking their\r\neyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\r\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed,\r\nand turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness\r\nof the shops where holly sprigs and berries\r\ncrackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale\r\nfaces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers'\r\ntrades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant,\r\nwith which it was next to impossible to believe that\r\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything\r\nto do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the\r\nmighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks\r\nand butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's\r\nhousehold should; and even the little tailor, whom he\r\nhad fined five shillings on the previous Monday for\r\nbeing drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up\r\nto-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean\r\nwife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.", "Foggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting\r\ncold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped\r\nthe Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such weather\r\nas that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then\r\nindeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The\r\nowner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled\r\nby the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\r\nstooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with\r\na Christmas carol: but at the first sound of", "        %(dialogue)s", "Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action,\r\nthat the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to\r\nthe fog and even more congenial frost.", "At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house\r\narrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his\r\nstool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant\r\nclerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out,\r\nand put on his hat.", "%(dialogue)s said\r\nScrooge.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge, %(dialogue)s", "The clerk smiled faintly.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge, %(dialogue)s", "The clerk observed that it was only once a year.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge, buttoning\r\nhis great-coat to the chin. %(dialogue)s", "The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge\r\nwalked out with a growl. The office was closed in a\r\ntwinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his\r\nwhite comforter dangling below his waist (for he\r\nboasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill,\r\nat the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in\r\nhonour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home\r\nto Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play\r\nat blindman's-buff.", "Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual\r\nmelancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and\r\nbeguiled the rest of the evening with his\r\nbanker's-book, went home to bed. He lived in\r\nchambers which had once belonged to his deceased\r\npartner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a\r\nlowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so\r\nlittle business to be, that one could scarcely help\r\nfancying it must have run there when it was a young\r\nhouse, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses,\r\nand forgotten the way out again. It was old enough\r\nnow, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but\r\nScrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.\r\nThe yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew\r\nits every stone, was fain to grope with his hands.\r\nThe fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway\r\nof the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of\r\nthe Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\r\nthreshold.", "Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all\r\nparticular about the knocker on the door, except that it\r\nwas very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had\r\nseen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\r\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what\r\nis called fancy about him as any man in the city of\r\nLondon, even including--which is a bold word--the\r\ncorporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be\r\nborne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one\r\nthought on Marley, since his last mention of his\r\nseven years' dead partner that afternoon. And then\r\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened\r\nthat Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,\r\nsaw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate\r\nprocess of change--not a knocker, but Marley's face.", "Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow\r\nas the other objects in the yard were, but had a\r\ndismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark\r\ncellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked\r\nat Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly\r\nspectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The\r\nhair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\r\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly\r\nmotionless. That, and its livid colour, made it\r\nhorrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the\r\nface and beyond its control, rather than a part of\r\nits own expression.", "As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it\r\nwas a knocker again.", "To say that he was not startled, or that his blood\r\nwas not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it\r\nhad been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue.\r\nBut he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished,\r\nturned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.", "He did pause, with a moment's irresolution, before\r\nhe shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind\r\nit first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the\r\nsight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the hall.\r\nBut there was nothing on the back of the door, except\r\nthe screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he\r\nsaid %(dialogue)s and closed it with a bang.", "The sound resounded through the house like thunder.\r\nEvery room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant's\r\ncellars below, appeared to have a separate peal\r\nof echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to\r\nbe frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and\r\nwalked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too:\r\ntrimming his candle as he went.", "You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six\r\nup a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad\r\nyoung Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you\r\nmight have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken\r\nit broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall\r\nand the door towards the balustrades: and done it\r\neasy. There was plenty of width for that, and room\r\nto spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge\r\nthought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before\r\nhim in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of\r\nthe street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well,\r\nso you may suppose that it was pretty dark with\r\nScrooge's dip.", "Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that.\r\nDarkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before\r\nhe shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms\r\nto see that all was right. He had just enough recollection\r\nof the face to desire to do that.", "Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they\r\nshould be. Nobody under the table, nobody under\r\nthe sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin\r\nready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had\r\na cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the\r\nbed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown,\r\nwhich was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\r\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard,\r\nold shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three\r\nlegs, and a poker.", "Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked\r\nhimself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his\r\ncustom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off\r\nhis cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and\r\nhis nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take\r\nhis gruel.", "It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a\r\nbitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and\r\nbrood over it, before he could extract the least\r\nsensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel.\r\nThe fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch\r\nmerchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint\r\nDutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.\r\nThere were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters;\r\nQueens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending\r\nthrough the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams,\r\nBelshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats,\r\nhundreds of figures to attract his thoughts;\r\nand yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came\r\nlike the ancient Prophet's rod, and swallowed up the\r\nwhole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first,\r\nwith power to shape some picture on its surface from\r\nthe disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would\r\nhave been a copy of old Marley's head on every one.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge; and walked across the\r\nroom.", "After several turns, he sat down again. As he\r\nthrew his head back in the chair, his glance happened\r\nto rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the\r\nroom, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten\r\nwith a chamber in the highest story of the\r\nbuilding. It was with great astonishment, and with\r\na strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he\r\nsaw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in\r\nthe outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it\r\nrang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.", "This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute,\r\nbut it seemed an hour. The bells ceased as they had\r\nbegun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking\r\nnoise, deep down below; as if some person were\r\ndragging a heavy chain over the casks in the\r\nwine-merchant's cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have\r\nheard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as\r\ndragging chains.", "The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound,\r\nand then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors\r\nbelow; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight\r\ntowards his door.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge. %(dialogue)s", "His colour changed though, when, without a pause,\r\nit came on through the heavy door, and passed into\r\nthe room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the\r\ndying flame leaped up, as though it cried, %(dialogue)s and fell again.", "The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail,\r\nusual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on\r\nthe latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts,\r\nand the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was\r\nclasped about his middle. It was long, and wound\r\nabout him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge\r\nobserved it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks,\r\nledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel.\r\nHis body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him,\r\nand looking through his waistcoat, could see\r\nthe two buttons on his coat behind.", "Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no\r\nbowels, but he had never believed it until now.", "No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he\r\nlooked the phantom through and through, and saw\r\nit standing before him; though he felt the chilling\r\ninfluence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very\r\ntexture of the folded kerchief bound about its head\r\nand chin, which wrapper he had not observed before;\r\nhe was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever.\r\n%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s--Marley's voice, no doubt about it.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge, raising his\r\nvoice. %(dialogue)s He was going\r\nto say %(dialogue)s but substituted this, as more\r\nappropriate.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s asked Scrooge, looking\r\ndoubtfully at him.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "Scrooge asked the question, because he didn't know\r\nwhether a ghost so transparent might find himself in\r\na condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event\r\nof its being impossible, it might involve the necessity\r\nof an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat\r\ndown on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he\r\nwere quite used to it.", "%(dialogue)s observed the Ghost.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge, %(dialogue)s", "Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking\r\njokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means\r\nwaggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be\r\nsmart, as a means of distracting his own attention,\r\nand keeping down his terror; for the spectre's voice\r\ndisturbed the very marrow in his bones.", "To sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence\r\nfor a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very\r\ndeuce with him. There was something very awful,\r\ntoo, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal\r\natmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it\r\nhimself, but this was clearly the case; for though the\r\nGhost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts,\r\nand tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour\r\nfrom an oven.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge, returning\r\nquickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned;\r\nand wishing, though it were only for a second, to\r\ndivert the vision's stony gaze from himself.", "%(dialogue)s replied the Ghost.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s said the Ghost, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s returned Scrooge, %(dialogue)s", "At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook\r\nits chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that\r\nScrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself\r\nfrom falling in a swoon. But how much greater was\r\nhis horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage\r\nround its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors,\r\nits lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!", "Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands\r\nbefore his face.", "%(dialogue)s he said. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied the Ghost, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s the Ghost returned,\r\n%(dialogue)s", "Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain\r\nand wrung its shadowy hands.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge, trembling. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied the Ghost.\r\n%(dialogue)s", "Scrooge trembled more and more.", "%(dialogue)s pursued the Ghost, %(dialogue)s", "Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the\r\nexpectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty\r\nor sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see\r\nnothing.", "%(dialogue)s he said, imploringly. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s the Ghost replied. %(dialogue)s", "It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became\r\nthoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets.\r\nPondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now,\r\nbut without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his\r\nknees.", "%(dialogue)s\r\nScrooge observed, in a business-like manner, though\r\nwith humility and deference.", "%(dialogue)s the Ghost repeated.", "%(dialogue)s mused Scrooge. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said the Ghost. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s replied the Ghost.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge.", "The Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and\r\nclanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of\r\nthe night, that the Ward would have been justified in\r\nindicting it for a nuisance.", "%(dialogue)s cried the\r\nphantom, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this\r\nto himself.", "%(dialogue)s cried the Ghost, wringing its hands\r\nagain. %(dialogue)s", "It held up its chain at arm's length, as if that were\r\nthe cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it\r\nheavily upon the ground again.", "%(dialogue)s the spectre said,\r\n%(dialogue)s", "Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the\r\nspectre going on at this rate, and began to quake\r\nexceedingly.", "%(dialogue)s cried the Ghost. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "It was not an agreeable idea.

Scrooge stopped.", "Not so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear:\r\nfor on the raising of the hand, he became sensible\r\nof confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of\r\nlamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and\r\nself-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment,\r\njoined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the\r\nbleak, dark night.", "Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his\r\ncuriosity. He looked out.", "The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither\r\nand thither in restless haste, and moaning as they\r\nwent. Every one of them wore chains like Marley's\r\nGhost; some few (they might be guilty governments)\r\nwere linked together; none were free. Many had\r\nbeen personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He\r\nhad been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white\r\nwaistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to\r\nits ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist\r\na wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below,\r\nupon a door-step. The misery with them all was,\r\nclearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in\r\nhuman matters, and had lost the power for ever.", "Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist\r\nenshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and\r\ntheir spirit voices faded together; and the night became\r\nas it had been when he walked home.", "Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door\r\nby which the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked,\r\nas he had locked it with his own hands, and\r\nthe bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say %(dialogue)s\r\nbut stopped at the first syllable. And being,\r\nfrom the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues\r\nof the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or\r\nthe dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of\r\nthe hour, much in need of repose; went straight to\r\nbed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the\r\ninstant.", "\r\nSTAVE II:  THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS", "WHEN Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed,\r\nhe could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from\r\nthe opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to\r\npierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a\r\nneighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened\r\nfor the hour.", "To his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from\r\nsix to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to\r\ntwelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he\r\nwent to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have\r\ngot into the works. Twelve!", "He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most\r\npreposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve:\r\nand stopped.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge, %(dialogue)s", "The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed,\r\nand groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub\r\nthe frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he\r\ncould see anything; and could see very little then. All he\r\ncould make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely\r\ncold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro,\r\nand making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been\r\nif night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the\r\nworld.  This was a great relief, because %(dialogue)s and so forth, would have become a mere United States'\r\nsecurity if there were no days to count by.", "Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought\r\nit over and over and over, and could make nothing of it.  The more he\r\nthought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured\r\nnot to think, the more he thought.", "Marley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved\r\nwithin himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his\r\nmind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first\r\nposition, and presented the same problem to be worked all through,\r\n%(dialogue)s", "Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters\r\nmore, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned\r\nhim of a visitation when the bell tolled one.  He resolved to lie\r\nawake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could\r\nno more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the\r\nwisest resolution in his power.", "The quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he\r\nmust have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock.\r\nAt length it broke upon his listening ear.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge, counting.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge, triumphantly, %(dialogue)s", "He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a\r\ndeep, dull, hollow, melancholy ONE.  Light flashed up in the room\r\nupon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.", "The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a\r\nhand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his\r\nback, but those to which his face was addressed. The curtains\r\nof his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a\r\nhalf-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the\r\nunearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now\r\nto you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.", "It was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so like a\r\nchild as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural\r\nmedium, which gave him the appearance of having receded\r\nfrom the view, and being diminished to a child's proportions.\r\nIts hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was\r\nwhite as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in\r\nit, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were\r\nvery long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold\r\nwere of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately\r\nformed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic\r\nof the purest white; and round its waist was bound\r\na lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held\r\na branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular\r\ncontradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed\r\nwith summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was,\r\nthat from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear\r\njet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was\r\ndoubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a\r\ngreat extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.", "Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing\r\nsteadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as its belt\r\nsparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another,\r\nand what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so\r\nthe figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a\r\nthing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs,\r\nnow a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a\r\nbody: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible\r\nin the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the\r\nvery wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and\r\nclear as ever.", "%(dialogue)s asked Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s", "The voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if\r\ninstead of being so close beside him, it were at a distance.", "%(dialogue)s Scrooge demanded.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s inquired Scrooge: observant of its dwarfish\r\nstature.", "%(dialogue)s", "Perhaps, Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if\r\nanybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire\r\nto see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered.", "%(dialogue)s exclaimed the Ghost, %(dialogue)s", "Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend\r\nor any knowledge of having wilfully %(dialogue)s the Spirit at\r\nany period of his life. He then made bold to inquire what\r\nbusiness brought him there.", "%(dialogue)s said the Ghost.", "Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not\r\nhelp thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been\r\nmore conducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard\r\nhim thinking, for it said immediately:", "%(dialogue)s", "It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him\r\ngently by the arm.", "%(dialogue)s", "It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the\r\nweather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes;\r\nthat bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below\r\nfreezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers,\r\ndressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at\r\nthat time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand,\r\nwas not to be resisted.

All these boys\r\nwere in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the\r\nbroad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air\r\nlaughed to hear it!", "%(dialogue)s said\r\nthe Ghost. %(dialogue)s", "The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge\r\nknew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond\r\nall bounds to see them! Why did his cold eye glisten, and\r\nhis heart leap up as they went past! Why was he filled\r\nwith gladness when he heard them give each other Merry\r\nChristmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for\r\ntheir several homes! What was merry Christmas to Scrooge?\r\nOut upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done\r\nto him?", "%(dialogue)s said the Ghost. %(dialogue)s", "Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.", "They left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and\r\nsoon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little\r\nweathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell\r\nhanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken\r\nfortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls\r\nwere damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their\r\ngates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables;\r\nand the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass.\r\nNor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for\r\nentering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open\r\ndoors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished,\r\ncold, and vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a\r\nchilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow\r\nwith too much getting up by candle-light, and not too\r\nmuch to eat.", "They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a\r\ndoor at the back of the house. It opened before them, and\r\ndisclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by\r\nlines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely\r\nboy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down\r\nupon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he\r\nused to be.", "Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle\r\nfrom the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the\r\nhalf-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among\r\nthe leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle\r\nswinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in\r\nthe fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening\r\ninfluence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.", "The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his\r\nyounger self, intent upon his reading.

The noise in this\r\nroom was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children\r\nthere, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;\r\nand, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not\r\nforty children conducting themselves like one, but every\r\nchild was conducting itself like forty. The consequences\r\nwere uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care;\r\non the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily,\r\nand enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\r\nmingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands\r\nmost ruthlessly.

As to measuring her waist in sport, as they\r\ndid, bold young brood, I couldn't have done it; I should\r\nhave expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment,\r\nand never come straight again.

Then the shouting and the struggling, and\r\nthe onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter!\r\nThe scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his\r\npockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight\r\nby his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back,\r\nand kick his legs in irrepressible affection!

The terrible announcement that the\r\nbaby had been taken in the act of putting a doll's frying-pan\r\ninto his mouth, and was more than suspected of having\r\nswallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter!\r\nThe immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy,\r\nand gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike.\r\nIt is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions\r\ngot out of the parlour, and by one stair at a time, up to the\r\ntop of the house; where they went to bed, and so subsided.", "And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever,\r\nwhen the master of the house, having his daughter leaning\r\nfondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his\r\nown fireside; and when he thought that such another\r\ncreature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might\r\nhave called him father, and been a spring-time in the\r\nhaggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.", "%(dialogue)s said the husband, turning to his wife with a\r\nsmile, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s she added in the\r\nsame breath, laughing as he laughed. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge in a broken voice, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said the Ghost. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s Scrooge exclaimed, %(dialogue)s", "He turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon\r\nhim with a face, in which in some strange way there were\r\nfragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it.", "%(dialogue)s", "In the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which\r\nthe Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was\r\nundisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed\r\nthat its light was burning high and bright; and dimly\r\nconnecting that with its influence over him, he seized the\r\nextinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down\r\nupon its head.", "The Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher\r\ncovered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down\r\nwith all his force, he could not hide the light: which streamed\r\nfrom under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.", "He was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an\r\nirresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own\r\nbedroom.  He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand\r\nrelaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank\r\ninto a heavy sleep.", "\r\nSTAVE III:  THE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS", "AWAKING in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and\r\nsitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had\r\nno occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the\r\nstroke of One. He felt that he was restored to consciousness\r\nin the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of holding\r\na conference with the second messenger despatched to him\r\nthrough Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he\r\nturned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which\r\nof his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put\r\nthem every one aside with his own hands; and lying down\r\nagain, established a sharp look-out all round the bed. For\r\nhe wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\r\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise, and\r\nmade nervous.", "Gentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves\r\non being acquainted with a move or two, and being usually\r\nequal to the time-of-day, express the wide range of their\r\ncapacity for adventure by observing that they are good for\r\nanything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between which\r\nopposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide and\r\ncomprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for\r\nScrooge quite as hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you\r\nto believe that he was ready for a good broad field of\r\nstrange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and\r\nrhinoceros would have astonished him very much.", "Now, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by\r\nany means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the\r\nBell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a\r\nviolent fit of trembling. Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter\r\nof an hour went by, yet nothing came. All this time, he lay\r\nupon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy\r\nlight, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\r\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than\r\na dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it\r\nmeant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive\r\nthat he might be at that very moment an interesting case of\r\nspontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of\r\nknowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you or\r\nI would have thought at first; for it is always the person not\r\nin the predicament who knows what ought to have been done\r\nin it, and would unquestionably have done it too--at last, I\r\nsay, he began to think that the source and secret of this\r\nghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence,\r\non further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea taking\r\nfull possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled in\r\nhis slippers to the door.", "The moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock, a strange\r\nvoice called him by his name, and bade him enter. He\r\nobeyed.", "It was his own room. There was no doubt about that.\r\nBut it had undergone a surprising transformation. The walls\r\nand ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a\r\nperfect grove; from every part of which, bright gleaming\r\nberries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and\r\nivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had\r\nbeen scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring\r\nup the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had\r\nnever known in Scrooge's time, or Marley's, or for many and\r\nmany a winter season gone. Heaped up on the floor, to form\r\na kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn,\r\ngreat joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\r\nmince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\r\ncherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears,\r\nimmense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that\r\nmade the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy\r\nstate upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to\r\nsee; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty's\r\nhorn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge,\r\nas he came peeping round the door.", "%(dialogue)s exclaimed the Ghost. %(dialogue)s", "Scrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this\r\nSpirit.

It was clothed in one simple\r\ngreen robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment\r\nhung so loosely on the figure, that its capacious breast was\r\nbare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any\r\nartifice. Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the\r\ngarment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other\r\ncovering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\r\nicicles. Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its\r\ngenial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice,\r\nits unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded\r\nround its middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword\r\nwas in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust.", "%(dialogue)s exclaimed\r\nthe Spirit.", "%(dialogue)s Scrooge made answer to it.", "%(dialogue)s pursued the Phantom.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said the Ghost.", "%(dialogue)s muttered Scrooge.", "The Ghost of Christmas Present rose.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge submissively, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.", "Holly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game,\r\npoultry, brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings,\r\nfruit, and punch, all vanished instantly. So did the room,\r\nthe fire, the ruddy glow, the hour of night, and they stood\r\nin the city streets on Christmas morning, where (for the\r\nweather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk and\r\nnot unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the\r\npavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of\r\ntheir houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see\r\nit come plumping down into the road below, and splitting\r\ninto artificial little snow-storms.", "The house fronts looked black enough, and the windows\r\nblacker, contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow\r\nupon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground;\r\nwhich last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by\r\nthe heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows that crossed\r\nand re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great\r\nstreets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace\r\nin the thick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy,\r\nand the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist,\r\nhalf thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended\r\nin a shower of sooty atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great\r\nBritain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were blazing away\r\nto their dear hearts' content. There was nothing very cheerful\r\nin the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of\r\ncheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest\r\nsummer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.", "For, the people who were shovelling away on the housetops\r\nwere jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another\r\nfrom the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious\r\nsnowball--better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest--\r\nlaughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it\r\nwent wrong. The poulterers' shops were still half open, and the\r\nfruiterers' were radiant in their glory. There were great, round,\r\npot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats\r\nof jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out\r\ninto the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were\r\nruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in\r\nthe fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking\r\nfrom their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went\r\nby, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were\r\npears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there\r\nwere bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers' benevolence\r\nto dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people's mouths might\r\nwater gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy\r\nand brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among\r\nthe woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered\r\nleaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting\r\noff the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great\r\ncompactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and\r\nbeseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after\r\ndinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among\r\nthese choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and\r\nstagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was\r\nsomething going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and\r\nround their little world in slow and passionless excitement.", "The Grocers'! oh, the Grocers'! nearly closed, with perhaps\r\ntwo shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such\r\nglimpses! It was not alone that the scales descending on the\r\ncounter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller\r\nparted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled\r\nup and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended\r\nscents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even\r\nthat the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so\r\nextremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight,\r\nthe other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and\r\nspotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on\r\nfeel faint and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that the figs\r\nwere moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in\r\nmodest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that\r\neverything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but\r\nthe customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful\r\npromise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other\r\nat the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left\r\ntheir purchases upon the counter, and came running back to\r\nfetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in\r\nthe best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people\r\nwere so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which\r\nthey fastened their aprons behind might have been their own,\r\nworn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws\r\nto peck at if they chose.", "But soon the steeples called good people all, to church and\r\nchapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in\r\ntheir best clothes, and with their gayest faces. And at the\r\nsame time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and\r\nnameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners\r\nto the bakers' shops. The sight of these poor revellers\r\nappeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with\r\nScrooge beside him in a baker's doorway, and taking off the\r\ncovers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their\r\ndinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind\r\nof torch, for once or twice when there were angry words\r\nbetween some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he\r\nshed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good\r\nhumour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame\r\nto quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love\r\nit, so it was!", "In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and\r\nyet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners\r\nand the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of\r\nwet above each baker's oven; where the pavement smoked as\r\nif its stones were cooking too.", "%(dialogue)s asked Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s\r\nasked Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s asked Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge, after a moment's thought, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s cried the Spirit.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s cried the Spirit.", "%(dialogue)s said\r\nScrooge. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s exclaimed the Spirit.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s returned the Spirit,\r\n%(dialogue)s", "Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on,\r\ninvisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the\r\ntown.

Mrs. Cratchit made\r\nthe gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot;\r\nMaster Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour;\r\nMiss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted\r\nthe hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny\r\ncorner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for\r\neverybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard\r\nupon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\r\nthey should shriek for goose before their turn came to be\r\nhelped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was\r\nsaid. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs.\r\nCratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared\r\nto plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the\r\nlong expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\r\ndelight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim,\r\nexcited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with\r\nthe handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!", "There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe\r\nthere ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and\r\nflavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal\r\nadmiration. Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes,\r\nit was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as\r\nMrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\r\natom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at\r\nlast! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest\r\nCratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to\r\nthe eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss\r\nBelinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous to\r\nbear witnesses--to take the pudding up and bring it in.", "Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should\r\nbreak in turning out! Suppose somebody should have got\r\nover the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they\r\nwere merry with the goose--a supposition at which the two\r\nyoung Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\r\nsupposed.", "Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of\r\nthe copper. A smell like a washing-day! That was the\r\ncloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook's next\r\ndoor to each other, with a laundress's next door to that!\r\nThat was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\r\nentered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding,\r\nlike a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half\r\nof half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with\r\nChristmas holly stuck into the top.", "Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly\r\ntoo, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by\r\nMrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that\r\nnow the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had\r\nhad her doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody had\r\nsomething to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\r\nwas at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have\r\nbeen flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed\r\nto hint at such a thing.", "At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the\r\nhearth swept, and the fire made up.

The mention of his name cast\r\na dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full\r\nfive minutes.", "After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than\r\nbefore, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done\r\nwith. Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his\r\neye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full\r\nfive-and-sixpence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed\r\ntremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man of business;\r\nand Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from\r\nbetween his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular\r\ninvestments he should favour when he came into the receipt\r\nof that bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor\r\napprentice at a milliner's, then told them what kind of work\r\nshe had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch,\r\nand how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a\r\ngood long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at\r\nhome. Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some\r\ndays before, and how the lord %(dialogue)s at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you\r\ncouldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All this\r\ntime the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and\r\nby-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in\r\nthe snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice,\r\nand sang it very well indeed.", "There was nothing of high mark in this. They were not\r\na handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes\r\nwere far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty;\r\nand Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside\r\nof a pawnbroker's. But, they were happy, grateful, pleased\r\nwith one another, and contented with the time; and when\r\nthey faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings\r\nof the Spirit's torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon\r\nthem, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.", "By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty\r\nheavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets,\r\nthe brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and\r\nall sorts of rooms, was wonderful. Here, the flickering of\r\nthe blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot\r\nplates baking through and through before the fire, and deep\r\nred curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.\r\nThere all the children of the house were running out\r\ninto the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins,\r\nuncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here, again,\r\nwere shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and\r\nthere a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted,\r\nand all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\r\nneighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw\r\nthem enter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!", "But, if you had judged from the numbers of people on\r\ntheir way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought\r\nthat no one was at home to give them welcome when they\r\ngot there, instead of every house expecting company, and\r\npiling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\r\nthe Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and\r\nopened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with\r\na generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything\r\nwithin its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before,\r\ndotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was\r\ndressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly\r\nas the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter\r\nthat he had any company but Christmas!", "And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they\r\nstood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses\r\nof rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place\r\nof giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed,\r\nor would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner;\r\nand nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass.\r\nDown in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\r\nred, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a\r\nsullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in\r\nthe thick gloom of darkest night.", "%(dialogue)s asked Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s returned the Spirit. %(dialogue)s", "A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they\r\nadvanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and\r\nstone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a\r\nglowing fire. An old, old man and woman, with their\r\nchildren and their children's children, and another generation\r\nbeyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\r\nThe old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling\r\nof the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a\r\nChristmas song--it had been a very old song when he was a\r\nboy--and from time to time they all joined in the chorus.\r\nSo surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite\r\nblithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour\r\nsank again.", "The Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his\r\nrobe, and passing on above the moor, sped--whither? Not\r\nto sea? To sea. To Scrooge's horror, looking back, he saw\r\nthe last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them;\r\nand his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it\r\nrolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it\r\nhad worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.", "Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league\r\nor so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed,\r\nthe wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse.\r\nGreat heaps of sea-weed clung to its base, and storm-birds\r\n--born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the\r\nwater--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.", "But even here, two men who watched the light had made\r\na fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed\r\nout a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their\r\nhorny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they\r\nwished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and\r\none of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and\r\nscarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship\r\nmight be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in\r\nitself.", "Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea\r\n--on, on--until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any\r\nshore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman\r\nat the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who\r\nhad the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations;\r\nbut every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\r\nhad a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his\r\ncompanion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward\r\nhopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or\r\nsleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another\r\non that day than on any day in the year; and had shared\r\nto some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those\r\nhe cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted\r\nto remember him.", "It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the\r\nmoaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it\r\nwas to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown\r\nabyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it\r\nwas a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear\r\na hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge\r\nto recognise it as his own nephew's and to find himself in a\r\nbright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling\r\nby his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving\r\naffability!", "%(dialogue)s laughed Scrooge's nephew. %(dialogue)s", "If you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a\r\nman more blest in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew, all I can\r\nsay is, I should like to know him too. Introduce him to me,\r\nand I'll cultivate his acquaintance.", "It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that\r\nwhile there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing\r\nin the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and\r\ngood-humour. When Scrooge's nephew laughed in this way: holding\r\nhis sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the\r\nmost extravagant contortions: Scrooge's niece, by marriage,\r\nlaughed as heartily as he. And their assembled friends being\r\nnot a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s cried\r\nScrooge's nephew. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge's niece,\r\nindignantly.

With a dimpled,\r\nsurprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that\r\nseemed made to be kissed--as no doubt it was; all kinds of\r\ngood little dots about her chin, that melted into one another\r\nwhen she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever\r\nsaw in any little creature's head. Altogether she was what\r\nyou would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory, too.\r\nOh, perfectly satisfactory.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge's nephew, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s hinted Scrooge's niece.\r\n%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge's nephew. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s observed Scrooge's niece.\r\nScrooge's niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed\r\nthe same opinion.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge's nephew. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s interrupted\r\nScrooge's niece. Everybody else said the same, and they\r\nmust be allowed to have been competent judges, because\r\nthey had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the\r\ntable, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge's nephew,\r\n%(dialogue)s", "Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's\r\nsisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast,\r\nwho had no right to express an opinion on the subject.\r\nWhereat Scrooge's niece's sister--the plump one with the lace\r\ntucker: not the one with the roses--blushed.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge's niece, clapping her hands.\r\n%(dialogue)s", "Scrooge's nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was\r\nimpossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister\r\ntried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was\r\nunanimously followed.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge's nephew, %(dialogue)s", "It was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking\r\nScrooge. But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much\r\ncaring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any\r\nrate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the\r\nbottle joyously.", "After tea, they had some music. For they were a musical\r\nfamily, and knew what they were about, when they sung a\r\nGlee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who\r\ncould growl away in the bass like a good one, and never\r\nswell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face\r\nover it. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and\r\nplayed among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing:\r\nyou might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had\r\nbeen familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the\r\nboarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of\r\nChristmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the\r\nthings that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he\r\nsoftened more and more; and thought that if he could have\r\nlistened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the\r\nkindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands,\r\nwithout resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob\r\nMarley.", "But they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After\r\na while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children\r\nsometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its\r\nmighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first\r\na game at blind-man's buff. Of course there was. And I\r\nno more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he\r\nhad eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done\r\nthing between him and Scrooge's nephew; and that the\r\nGhost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after\r\nthat plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the\r\ncredulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons,\r\ntumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano,\r\nsmothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went,\r\nthere went he! He always knew where the plump sister was.\r\nHe wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had fallen up\r\nagainst him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would\r\nhave made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would\r\nhave been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly\r\nhave sidled off in the direction of the plump sister.\r\nShe often cried out that it wasn't fair; and it really was not.\r\nBut when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her\r\nsilken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got\r\nher into a corner whence there was no escape; then his\r\nconduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to\r\nknow her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her\r\nhead-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by\r\npressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain\r\nabout her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told\r\nhim her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in\r\noffice, they were so very confidential together, behind the\r\ncurtains.", "Scrooge's niece was not one of the blind-man's buff party,\r\nbut was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool,\r\nin a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close\r\nbehind her. But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her\r\nlove to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet.\r\nLikewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was\r\nvery great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat\r\nher sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper\r\ncould have told you. There might have been twenty people there,\r\nyoung and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for\r\nwholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that\r\nhis voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with\r\nhis guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too;\r\nfor the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut\r\nin the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in\r\nhis head to be.", "The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood,\r\nand looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like\r\na boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed. But\r\nthis the Spirit said could not be done.", "%(dialogue)s said Scrooge. %(dialogue)s", "It was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew\r\nhad to think of something, and the rest must find out what;\r\nhe only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case\r\nwas. The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed,\r\nelicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live\r\nanimal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an\r\nanimal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes,\r\nand lived in London, and walked about the streets,\r\nand wasn't made a show of, and wasn't led by anybody, and\r\ndidn't live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market,\r\nand was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a\r\ntiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every fresh\r\nquestion that was put to him, this nephew burst into a\r\nfresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that\r\nhe was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp. At last\r\nthe plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s cried Fred.", "%(dialogue)s", "Which it certainly was.

But the whole scene\r\npassed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his\r\nnephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.", "Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they\r\nvisited, but always with a happy end. The Spirit stood\r\nbeside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands,\r\nand they were close at home; by struggling men, and they\r\nwere patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was\r\nrich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery's every\r\nrefuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not\r\nmade fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his\r\nblessing, and taught Scrooge his precepts.", "It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge\r\nhad his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared\r\nto be condensed into the space of time they passed\r\ntogether. It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained\r\nunaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly\r\nolder. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of\r\nit, until they left a children's Twelfth Night party, when,\r\nlooking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place,\r\nhe noticed that its hair was grey.", "%(dialogue)s asked Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s replied the Ghost.\r\n%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s cried Scrooge.", "%(dialogue)s", "The chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at\r\nthat moment.", "%(dialogue)s said\r\nScrooge, looking intently at the Spirit's robe, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s was\r\nthe Spirit's sorrowful reply. %(dialogue)s", "From the foldings of its robe, it brought two children;\r\nwretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable.

Nor could he think of any\r\none immediately connected with himself, to whom he could\r\napply them.

Secrets\r\nthat few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in\r\nmountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and\r\nsepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a\r\ncharcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal,\r\nnearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the\r\ncold air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous\r\ntatters, hung upon a line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury\r\nof calm retirement.", "Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this\r\nman, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the\r\nshop. But she had scarcely entered, when another woman,\r\nsimilarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by\r\na man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight\r\nof them, than they had been upon the recognition of each\r\nother.

Its steady hand\r\nwas pointed to the head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted\r\nthat the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon\r\nScrooge's part, would have disclosed the face. He thought\r\nof it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it;\r\nbut had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss\r\nthe spectre at his side.", "Oh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar\r\nhere, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy\r\ncommand: for this is thy dominion! But of the loved,\r\nrevered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair\r\nto thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is\r\nnot that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released;\r\nit is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the\r\nhand WAS open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm,\r\nand tender; and the pulse a man's.

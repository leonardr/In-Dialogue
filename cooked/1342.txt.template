They attacked him\r\nin various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\r\ndistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at\r\nlast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,\r\nLady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been\r\ndelighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\r\nagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly\r\nwith a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of\r\ndancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively\r\nhopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.", "%(dialogue)s\r\nsaid Mrs. Bennet to her husband, %(dialogue)s", "In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about\r\nten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being\r\nadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had\r\nheard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more\r\nfortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper\r\nwindow that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.", "An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already\r\nhad Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her\r\nhousekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley\r\nwas obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable\r\nto accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite\r\ndisconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town\r\nso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that\r\nhe might be always flying about from one place to another, and never\r\nsettled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears\r\na little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get\r\na large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley\r\nwas to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.\r\nThe girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the\r\nday before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only\r\nsix with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when\r\nthe party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five\r\naltogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and\r\nanother young man.", "Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\r\ncountenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,\r\nwith an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely\r\nlooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention\r\nof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and\r\nthe report which was in general circulation within five minutes\r\nafter his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen\r\npronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he\r\nwas much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great\r\nadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\r\nwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\r\nproud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all\r\nhis large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\r\nforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared\r\nwith his friend.", "Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\r\npeople in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\r\nwas angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving\r\none himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for\r\nthemselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced\r\nonly once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\r\nintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\r\nwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\r\nHis character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\r\nin the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.\r\nAmongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of\r\nhis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\r\nhaving slighted one of her daughters.", "Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\r\ndown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\r\nstanding near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.\r\nBingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend\r\nto join it.", "%(dialogue)s said he, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s cried Mr. Bingley, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Mr.\r\nDarcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s and turning round he looked for a moment at\r\nElizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:\r\n%(dialogue)s", "Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\r\nremained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,\r\nhowever, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\r\nplayful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.", "The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\r\nBennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\r\nparty. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\r\ndistinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as\r\nher mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's\r\npleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\r\naccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\r\nfortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they\r\nhad yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\r\nspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\r\nwere the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With\r\na book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\r\ngood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\r\nsuch splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's views on\r\nthe stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a\r\ndifferent story to hear.", "%(dialogue)s as she entered the room, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s cried her husband impatiently,\r\n%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\r\ndescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\r\nof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some\r\nexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.", "%(dialogue)s she added, %(dialogue)s", "", "Chapter 4", "\r\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in\r\nher praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very\r\nmuch she admired him.", "%(dialogue)s said she, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Elizabeth, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at\r\nthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\r\nquickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,\r\nand with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she\r\nwas very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine\r\nladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the\r\npower of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and\r\nconceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the\r\nfirst private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand\r\npounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of\r\nassociating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect\r\nentitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of\r\na respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply\r\nimpressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their\r\nown had been acquired by trade.", "Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\r\nthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an\r\nestate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\r\nsometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a\r\ngood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\r\nwho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\r\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\r\npurchase.", "His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,\r\nthough he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\r\nmeans unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\r\nmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\r\nhis house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\r\nage two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation\r\nto look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for\r\nhalf-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal\r\nrooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it\r\nimmediately.", "Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of\r\ngreat opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\r\neasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition\r\ncould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\r\nnever appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley\r\nhad the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.\r\nIn understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means\r\ndeficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,\r\nreserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not\r\ninviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley\r\nwas sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\r\ngiving offense.", "The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\r\ncharacteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or\r\nprettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive\r\nto him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt\r\nacquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not\r\nconceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a\r\ncollection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for\r\nnone of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received\r\neither attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,\r\nbut she smiled too much.", "Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired\r\nher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one\r\nwhom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\r\nestablished as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such\r\ncommendation to think of her as he chose.", "", "Chapter 5", "\r\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets\r\nwere particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\r\nin Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the\r\nhonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.\r\nThe distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a\r\ndisgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;\r\nand, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house\r\nabout a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,\r\nwhere he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,\r\nunshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all\r\nthe world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him\r\nsupercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By\r\nnature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.\r\nJames's had made him courteous.", "Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\r\nvaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest\r\nof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was\r\nElizabeth's intimate friend.", "That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over\r\na ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly\r\nbrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.", "%(dialogue)s said Mrs. Bennet with civil\r\nself-command to Miss Lucas. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said\r\nCharlotte. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Jane.\r\n%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Jane, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Miss Lucas, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said her mother, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Miss Lucas, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Elizabeth, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\r\nreflections, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s cried a young Lucas, who came with\r\nhis sisters, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Mrs.\r\nBennet; %(dialogue)s", "The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she\r\nwould, and the argument ended only with the visit.", "", "Chapter 6", "\r\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit\r\nwas soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on\r\nthe goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was\r\nfound to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,\r\na wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards\r\nthe two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest\r\npleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment\r\nof everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\r\nthough their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in\r\nall probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It\r\nwas generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and\r\nto _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\r\nwhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\r\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\r\nwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\r\nunited, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a\r\nuniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions\r\nof the impertinent.

Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely\r\nallowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the\r\nball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no\r\nsooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly\r\nhad a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\r\nuncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To\r\nthis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had\r\ndetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry\r\nin her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\r\npleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\r\nof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of\r\nthis she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made\r\nhimself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough\r\nto dance with.", "He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing\r\nwith her himself, attended to her conversation with others.

Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\r\nmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\r\nend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\r\nScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,\r\nwith some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in\r\ndancing at one end of the room.", "Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\r\npassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\r\nmuch engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was\r\nhis neighbour, till Sir William thus began:", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "Sir William only smiled. %(dialogue)s he\r\ncontinued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "Mr. Darcy bowed.", "%(dialogue)s", "He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed\r\nto make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was\r\nstruck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to\r\nher:", "%(dialogue)s\r\nAnd, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though\r\nextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly\r\ndrew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:", "%(dialogue)s", "Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of\r\nher hand, but in vain.

The subjection in which his father had brought him up had\r\ngiven him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a\r\ngood deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in\r\nretirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected\r\nprosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\r\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which\r\nhe felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,\r\nmingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a\r\nclergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\r\npride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.", "Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to\r\nmarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had\r\na wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found\r\nthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.\r\nThis was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's\r\nestate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\r\nsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own\r\npart.", "His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face\r\nconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what\r\nwas due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled\r\nchoice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a\r\nquarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a\r\nconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally\r\nto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at\r\nLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\r\nencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. %(dialogue)s", "Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon\r\ndone--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally\r\nnext to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.", "Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have\r\ntwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of\r\nthe day before was now high in her good graces.", "Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister\r\nexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,\r\nat the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\r\nand have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed\r\nhim after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with\r\none of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.\r\nBennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such\r\ndoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\r\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\r\nElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the\r\nhouse, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,\r\nwas most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their\r\nwalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\r\nthan a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.", "In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\r\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.

Their eyes were\r\nimmediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and\r\nnothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in\r\na shop window, could recall them.", "But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\r\nthey had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking\r\nwith another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was\r\nthe very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came\r\nto inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the\r\nstranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,\r\ndetermined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under\r\npretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately\r\nhad just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had\r\nreached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated\r\npermission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with\r\nhim the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a\r\ncommission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the\r\nyoung man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.\r\nHis appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of\r\nbeauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.\r\nThe introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness\r\nof conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and\r\nunassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together\r\nvery agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy\r\nand Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the\r\nladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and\r\nbegan the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and\r\nMiss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to\r\nLongbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated\r\nit with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes\r\non Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the\r\nstranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they\r\nlooked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.\r\nBoth changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,\r\nafter a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just\r\ndeigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to\r\nimagine; it was impossible not to long to know.", "In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\r\npassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.", "Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\r\nMr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's\r\npressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of\r\nMrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the\r\ninvitation.", "Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,\r\nfrom their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was\r\neagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as\r\ntheir own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing\r\nabout, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the\r\nstreet, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to\r\nNetherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility\r\nwas claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She\r\nreceived him with her very best politeness, which he returned with\r\nas much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous\r\nacquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,\r\nhowever, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who\r\nintroduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an\r\nexcess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon\r\nput to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,\r\nhowever, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that\r\nMr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a\r\nlieutenant's commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the\r\nlast hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.\r\nWickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the\r\noccupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the\r\nofficers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become %(dialogue)s Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses\r\nthe next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\r\nWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\r\nwould come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips\r\nprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\r\ntickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such\r\ndelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\r\nCollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured\r\nwith unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.", "As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\r\nbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either\r\nor both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain\r\nsuch behaviour than her sister.", "Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring\r\nMrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady\r\nCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;\r\nfor she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even\r\npointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although\r\nutterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be\r\nattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so\r\nmuch attention in the whole course of his life.", "", "Chapter 16", "\r\nAs no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their\r\naunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for\r\na single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach\r\nconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and\r\nthe girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,\r\nthat Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in\r\nthe house.", "When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.\r\nCollins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\r\nstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he\r\nmight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast\r\nparlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much\r\ngratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what\r\nRosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the\r\ndescription of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found\r\nthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\r\nthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\r\nwith the housekeeper's room.", "In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\r\nwith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and\r\nthe improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the\r\ngentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive\r\nlistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she\r\nheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as\r\nsoon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\r\nand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\r\ntheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the\r\ninterval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.\r\nThe gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,\r\nElizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking\r\nof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.\r\nThe officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,\r\ngentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but\r\nMr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and\r\nwalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,\r\nbreathing port wine, who followed them into the room.", "Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\r\nturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\r\nhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\r\nconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel\r\nthat the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered\r\ninteresting by the skill of the speaker.", "With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the\r\nofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young\r\nladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind\r\nlistener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly\r\nsupplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he\r\nhad the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.", "%(dialogue)s said he, %(dialogue)s Mrs. Phillips was very\r\nglad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.", "Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\r\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there\r\nseemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\r\ndetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\r\nshe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\r\nand exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.\r\nAllowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore\r\nat leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear\r\nhim, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be\r\ntold--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not\r\neven mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\r\nrelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.

The\r\npossibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to\r\ninterest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be\r\ndone, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,\r\nand throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be\r\notherwise explained.", "%(dialogue)s said she, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "But Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,\r\nif he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair\r\nbecame public.", "The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this\r\nconversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had\r\nbeen speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal\r\ninvitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed\r\nfor the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their\r\ndear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly\r\nasked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To\r\nthe rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet\r\nas much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to\r\nthe others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an\r\nactivity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if\r\neager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.", "The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\r\nfemale of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in\r\ncompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered\r\nby receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a\r\nceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\r\nsociety of her two friends, and the attentions of her brother; and\r\nElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\r\nWickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look\r\nand behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended\r\nless on any single event, or any particular person, for though they\r\neach, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\r\nhe was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball\r\nwas, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she\r\nhad no disinclination for it.", "%(dialogue)s said she, %(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did\r\nnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking\r\nhim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if\r\nhe did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's\r\namusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no\r\nscruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke\r\neither from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to\r\ndance.", "%(dialogue)s said he, %(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.

Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforce\r\ndelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as\r\ngood a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his\r\ngallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first\r\nstruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy\r\nof being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\r\nquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\r\nThe idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\r\ncivilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\r\ncompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\r\ngratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\r\nher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\r\nwas extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose\r\nto take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\r\nconsequence of any reply.

No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very\r\nshoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have\r\nfound some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the\r\nimprovement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than\r\na dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and\r\nMonday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.", "", "Chapter 18", "\r\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in\r\nvain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a\r\ndoubt of his being present had never occurred to her.

She had dressed with more than\r\nusual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all\r\nthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than\r\nmight be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose\r\nthe dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's\r\npleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though\r\nthis was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\r\npronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who\r\ntold them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the\r\nday before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,\r\n%(dialogue)s", "This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\r\nElizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\r\nWickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every\r\nfeeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\r\ndisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to\r\nthe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.\r\nAttendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She\r\nwas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away\r\nwith a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in\r\nspeaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.", "But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\r\nof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\r\nspirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had\r\nnot seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition\r\nto the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular\r\nnotice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;\r\nthey were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\r\napologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being\r\naware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable\r\npartner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from\r\nhim was ecstasy.", "She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\r\nWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\r\nwere over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\r\nher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took\r\nher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,\r\nwithout knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again\r\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\r\nmind; Charlotte tried to console her:", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\r\nhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a\r\nsimpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\r\nin the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\r\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\r\nshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\r\nreading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding\r\nit. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\r\nimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at\r\nfirst was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would\r\nbe the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made\r\nsome slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\r\nsilent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time\r\nwith:--%(dialogue)s", "He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\r\nsaid.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Elizabeth archly; %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s\r\nsaid he. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down\r\nthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\r\nwalk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist\r\nthe temptation, added, %(dialogue)s", "The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\r\nfeatures, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\r\nfor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\r\nconstrained manner said, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Elizabeth\r\nwith emphasis, %(dialogue)s", "Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\r\nthat moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\r\nthrough the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.\r\nDarcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on\r\nhis dancing and his partner.", "%(dialogue)s", "The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\r\nWilliam's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\r\neyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and\r\nJane, who were dancing together.

Jane met her with a smile of\r\nsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\r\nmarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\r\nElizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for\r\nWickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way\r\nbefore the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.", "%(dialogue)s said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\r\nsister's, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Jane, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Elizabeth warmly;\r\n%(dialogue)s", "She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\r\nwhich there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\r\ndelight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.\r\nBingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\r\nin it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\r\nto Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\r\npartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\r\nand told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as\r\nto make a most important discovery.", "%(dialogue)s said he, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him\r\nthat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction\r\nas an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that\r\nit was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\r\nside; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\r\nconsequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her\r\nwith the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she\r\nceased speaking, replied thus:", "%(dialogue)s And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.\r\nDarcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose\r\nastonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced\r\nhis speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of\r\nit, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the\r\nwords %(dialogue)s \"Hunsford,%(dialogue)s It vexed\r\nher to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him\r\nwith unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time\r\nto speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,\r\nwas not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed\r\nabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the\r\nend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.\r\nCollins then returned to Elizabeth.", "%(dialogue)s said he, %(dialogue)s", "As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\r\nher attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the\r\ntrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,\r\nmade her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in\r\nthat very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection\r\ncould bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of\r\nendeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts\r\nshe plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to\r\nventure near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to\r\nsupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\r\nplaced them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find\r\nthat her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,\r\nopenly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon\r\nbe married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet\r\nseemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the\r\nmatch. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but\r\nthree miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and\r\nthen it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of\r\nJane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\r\nshe could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\r\ndaughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of\r\nother rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be\r\nable to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that\r\nshe might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was\r\nnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on\r\nsuch occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\r\nBennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She\r\nconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\r\nfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\r\nchance of it.", "In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's\r\nwords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\r\nwhisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the\r\nchief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\r\nmother only scolded her for being nonsensical.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would\r\ntalk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and\r\nblushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\r\nglancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\r\nshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\r\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\r\nof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\r\nsteady gravity.", "At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\r\nhad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\r\nlikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and\r\nchicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\r\ntranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and\r\nshe had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\r\npreparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\r\nentreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,\r\nbut in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of\r\nexhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's\r\neyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her\r\nprogress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very\r\nill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks\r\nof the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to\r\nfavour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.\r\nMary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was\r\nweak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at\r\nJane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to\r\nBingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs\r\nof derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\r\nimperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\r\ninterference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\r\nand when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, %(dialogue)s", "Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\r\nElizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid\r\nher anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.", "%(dialogue)s said Mr. Collins, %(dialogue)s And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had\r\nbeen spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many\r\nsmiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his\r\nwife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,\r\nand observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably\r\nclever, good kind of young man.", "To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to\r\nexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\r\nhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or\r\nfiner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\r\nthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\r\nfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\r\nmust have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\r\nhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,\r\nand she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the\r\ngentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.", "The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\r\nMr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though\r\nhe could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her\r\npower to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\r\nsomebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.\r\nHe assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;\r\nthat his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\r\nher and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her\r\nthe whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed\r\nher greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and\r\ngood-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.", "She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice;\r\nthough often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\r\ndisengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\r\nprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\r\nit.", "The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by\r\na manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of\r\nan hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how\r\nheartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\r\nsister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and\r\nwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\r\nevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a\r\nlanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the\r\nlong speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\r\nsisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\r\npoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\r\nnothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\r\nMr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the\r\nrest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\r\nsilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\r\nmuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of %(dialogue)s accompanied by a violent yawn.", "When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\r\ncivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and\r\naddressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he\r\nwould make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without\r\nthe ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,\r\nand he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on\r\nher, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next\r\nday for a short time.", "Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the\r\ndelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\r\nsettlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\r\nsee her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four\r\nmonths. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought\r\nwith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\r\nElizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\r\nman and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\r\nwas eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.", "", "Chapter 19", "\r\nThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his\r\ndeclaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\r\nhis leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\r\nno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at\r\nthe moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\r\nobservances, which he supposed a regular part of the business.

The next was in these words: %(dialogue)s To these highflown\r\nexpressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;\r\nand though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw\r\nnothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their\r\nabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as\r\nto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to\r\nregard it, in the enjoyment of his.", "%(dialogue)s said she, after a short pause, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s added Jane, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Jane as she\r\nfinished it. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "Jane shook her head.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Jane, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Elizabeth; %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Jane, faintly smiling. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\r\ncontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's\r\ninterested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those\r\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\r\nso totally independent of everyone.", "She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt\r\non the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\r\nJane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,\r\nthough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\r\nBingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.", "They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\r\nfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;\r\nbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\r\nand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\r\nto go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\r\nlamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.\r\nBingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the\r\nconclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had\r\nbeen invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two\r\nfull courses.", "", "Chapter 22", "\r\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the\r\nchief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.\r\nElizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. %(dialogue)s said she, %(dialogue)s\r\nCharlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and\r\nthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was\r\nvery amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth\r\nhad any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her\r\nfrom any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards\r\nherself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so\r\nfavourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\r\nsecure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very\r\nsoon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\r\ncharacter, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\r\nmorning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\r\nhimself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\r\nfrom a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\r\nconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\r\ntill its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost\r\nsecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\r\nhe was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.\r\nHis reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas\r\nperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\r\ninstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had\r\nshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.", "In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,\r\neverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as\r\nthey entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that\r\nwas to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must\r\nbe waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with\r\nhis happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\r\nguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\r\ncontinuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure\r\nand disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\r\nestablishment were gained.", "Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;\r\nand it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present\r\ncircumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom\r\nthey could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were\r\nexceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more\r\ninterest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer\r\nMr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided\r\nopinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the\r\nLongbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife\r\nshould make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short,\r\nwere properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes\r\nof _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have\r\ndone; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's\r\ndying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had\r\ngained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were\r\nin general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible\r\nnor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must\r\nbe imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly\r\neither of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was\r\nthe only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,\r\nand however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest\r\npreservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at\r\nthe age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all\r\nthe good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business\r\nwas the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship\r\nshe valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,\r\nand probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be\r\nshaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved\r\nto give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\r\nwhen he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\r\npassed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very\r\ndutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\r\ncuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct\r\nquestions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\r\nat the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\r\npublish his prosperous love.", "As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the\r\nfamily, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved\r\nfor the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,\r\nsaid how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever\r\nhis engagements might allow him to visit them.", "%(dialogue)s he replied, %(dialogue)s", "They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for\r\nso speedy a return, immediately said:", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Mr. Collins, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\r\nsurprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to\r\nunderstand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her\r\nyounger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\r\nShe rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was\r\na solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no\r\nmeans so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read\r\nand improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\r\nagreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this\r\nkind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\r\nprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.", "The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her\r\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but\r\nthat Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from\r\npossibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was\r\nconsequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and\r\nshe could not help crying out:", "%(dialogue)s", "The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\r\nstory, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\r\nreproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained\r\nher composure, and calmly replied:", "%(dialogue)s", "But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort\r\nfor it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of\r\ntheir relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her\r\nall imaginable happiness.", "%(dialogue)s replied Charlotte. %(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth quietly answered %(dialogue)s and after an awkward pause,\r\nthey returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\r\nlonger, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.\r\nIt was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\r\nunsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers\r\nof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\r\naccepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was\r\nnot exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible\r\nthat, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\r\nfeeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a\r\nmost humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself\r\nand sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it\r\nwas impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had\r\nchosen.", "", "Chapter 23", "\r\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what\r\nshe had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention\r\nit, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to\r\nannounce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,\r\nand much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the\r\nhouses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but\r\nincredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,\r\nprotested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and\r\noften uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:", "%(dialogue)s", "Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\r\nwithout anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried\r\nhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\r\ntruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\r\nmost forbearing courtesy.", "Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\r\na situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\r\nmentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\r\nendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters\r\nby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\r\nwas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\r\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\r\nof Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.", "Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while\r\nSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\r\nfound a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\r\nthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\r\nhad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be\r\nhappy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two\r\ninferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that\r\nElizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she\r\nherself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two\r\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\r\nconsole and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her\r\nresentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\r\nscolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\r\nor Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she\r\ncould at all forgive their daughter.", "Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such\r\nas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for\r\nit gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had\r\nbeen used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and\r\nmore foolish than his daughter!", "Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said\r\nless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;\r\nnor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty\r\nand Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a\r\nclergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news\r\nto spread at Meryton.", "Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort\r\non Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she\r\ncalled at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,\r\nthough Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been\r\nenough to drive happiness away.", "Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them\r\nmutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that\r\nno real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her\r\ndisappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her\r\nsister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could\r\nnever be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,\r\nas Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his\r\nreturn.", "Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting\r\nthe days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised\r\nletter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to\r\ntheir father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a\r\ntwelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging\r\nhis conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many\r\nrapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection\r\nof their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was\r\nmerely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready\r\nto close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither\r\nhe hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,\r\nhe added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take\r\nplace as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable\r\nargument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him\r\nthe happiest of men.", "Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\r\npleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to\r\ncomplain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come\r\nto Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\r\nand exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house\r\nwhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\r\nmost disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and\r\nthey gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued\r\nabsence.", "Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after\r\nday passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the\r\nreport which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to\r\nNetherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.\r\nBennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous\r\nfalsehood.", "Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that\r\nhis sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as\r\nshe was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so\r\ndishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its\r\nfrequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters\r\nand of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss\r\nDarcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for\r\nthe strength of his attachment.", "As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more\r\npainful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of\r\nconcealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject\r\nwas never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,\r\nan hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her\r\nimpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he\r\ndid not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed\r\nall Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\r\ntranquillity.", "Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his\r\nreception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his\r\nfirst introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;\r\nand luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\r\nfrom a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by\r\nhim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time\r\nto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.", "Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of\r\nanything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,\r\nand wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight\r\nof Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she\r\nregarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see\r\nthem, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\r\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that\r\nthey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\r\nand her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She\r\ncomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.", "%(dialogue)s said she, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of\r\nmaking any answer, she went on as before.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Mr. Bennet.", "", "Chapter 24", "\r\nMiss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first\r\nsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for\r\nthe winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had\r\ntime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left\r\nthe country.", "Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest\r\nof the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the\r\nwriter, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied\r\nthe chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline\r\nboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict\r\nthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former\r\nletter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an\r\ninmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of\r\nthe latter with regard to new furniture.", "Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,\r\nheard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern\r\nfor her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline's\r\nassertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no\r\ncredit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\r\nhad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she\r\ncould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\r\nof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave\r\nof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness\r\nto the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,\r\nbeen the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in\r\nwhatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as\r\nshe thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,\r\non which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She\r\ncould think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really\r\ndied away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether\r\nhe had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his\r\nobservation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be\r\nmaterially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained\r\nthe same, her peace equally wounded.", "A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to\r\nElizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a\r\nlonger irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could\r\nnot help saying:", "%(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said\r\nnothing.", "%(dialogue)s cried Jane, slightly colouring; %(dialogue)s", "With a stronger voice she soon added, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s exclaimed Elizabeth, %(dialogue)s", "Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back\r\nthe praise on her sister's warm affection.", "%(dialogue)s said Elizabeth, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied\r\nJane; %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s\r\nsaid Elizabeth; %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Jane;\r\n%(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's\r\nname was scarcely ever mentioned between them.", "Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no\r\nmore, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account\r\nfor it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with\r\nless perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she\r\ndid not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the\r\neffect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her\r\nno more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at\r\nthe time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's best\r\ncomfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.", "Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. %(dialogue)s said he one day,\r\n%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Mr. Bennet, %(dialogue)s", "Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom\r\nwhich the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn\r\nfamily. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now\r\nadded that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already\r\nheard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,\r\nwas now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was\r\npleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they\r\nhad known anything of the matter.", "Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be\r\nany extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society\r\nof Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for\r\nallowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else\r\nMr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.", "", "Chapter 25", "\r\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,\r\nMr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of\r\nSaturday.

He took leave of his\r\nrelations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair\r\ncousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another\r\nletter of thanks.", "On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving\r\nher brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas\r\nat Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly\r\nsuperior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield\r\nladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived\r\nby trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so\r\nwell-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger\r\nthan Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant\r\nwoman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the\r\ntwo eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.\r\nThey had frequently been staying with her in town.", "The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival was to\r\ndistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was\r\ndone she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.\r\nMrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They\r\nhad all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.

It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that\r\nhis affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends\r\nsuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's\r\nattractions.", "Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the\r\nBingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she\r\nhoped by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,\r\nshe might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of\r\nseeing him.", "The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,\r\nthe Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its\r\nengagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment\r\nof her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family\r\ndinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always\r\nmade part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and\r\non these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's\r\nwarm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,\r\nfrom what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference\r\nof each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and\r\nshe resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left\r\nHertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such\r\nan attachment.", "To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,\r\nunconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,\r\nbefore her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very\r\npart of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many\r\nacquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since\r\nthe death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher\r\nintelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of\r\nprocuring.", "Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by\r\ncharacter perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject\r\nof discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute\r\ndescription which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of\r\npraise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both\r\nhim and herself.

Elizabeth could never\r\naddress her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,\r\nand though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the\r\nsake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters\r\nwere received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be\r\ncuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would\r\nlike Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to\r\nbe; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte\r\nexpressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She\r\nwrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing\r\nwhich she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\r\nroads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most\r\nfriendly and obliging.

She would not\r\neven wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on\r\nevery review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible\r\nadvantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.\r\nDarcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly\r\nregret what he had thrown away.", "Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\r\nconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth\r\nhad such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to\r\nherself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,\r\nhe was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to\r\nsee it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.\r\nHer heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied\r\nwith believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune\r\npermitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most\r\nremarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself\r\nagreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than\r\nin Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.\r\nNothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to\r\nsuppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was\r\nready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very\r\nsincerely wish him happy.", "All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the\r\ncircumstances, she thus went on: %(dialogue)s", "", "Chapter 27", "\r\nWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise\r\ndiversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and\r\nsometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take\r\nElizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of\r\ngoing thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan\r\nand she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure\r\nas well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing\r\nCharlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There\r\nwas novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\r\nuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change\r\nwas not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her\r\na peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have\r\nbeen very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,\r\nand was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was\r\nto accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement\r\nof spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became\r\nperfect as plan could be.", "The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,\r\nand who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he\r\ntold her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.", "The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on\r\nhis side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that\r\nElizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the\r\nfirst to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner\r\nof bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of\r\nwhat she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their\r\nopinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there\r\nwas a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to\r\nhim with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,\r\nwhether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable\r\nand pleasing.", "Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her\r\nthink him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a\r\ngood-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say\r\nthat could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much\r\ndelight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but\r\nshe had known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of\r\nthe wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were\r\nworn out, like his information.", "It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early\r\nas to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's\r\ndoor, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when\r\nthey entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,\r\nlooking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and\r\nlovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\r\nwhose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to\r\nwait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen\r\nher for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\r\nkindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and\r\nshopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.", "Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her\r\nsister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to\r\nher minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her\r\nspirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,\r\nto hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the\r\nparticulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and\r\nrepeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\r\nherself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\r\nacquaintance.", "Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and\r\ncomplimented her on bearing it so well.", "%(dialogue)s she added, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s cried Elizabeth, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the\r\nunexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in\r\na tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.", "%(dialogue)s said Mrs. Gardiner,\r\n%(dialogue)s", "No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her\r\nacceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. %(dialogue)s she rapturously cried, %(dialogue)s", "", "Chapter 28", "\r\nEvery object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to\r\nElizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had\r\nseen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,\r\nand the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.", "When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in\r\nsearch of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.\r\nThe palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth\r\nsmiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.", "At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the\r\nroad, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,\r\neverything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte\r\nappeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which\r\nled by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of\r\nthe whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing\r\nat the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the\r\nliveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with\r\ncoming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw\r\ninstantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage;\r\nhis formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some\r\nminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her\r\nfamily. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the\r\nneatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they\r\nwere in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious\r\nformality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's\r\noffers of refreshment.", "Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help\r\nin fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its\r\naspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,\r\nas if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But\r\nthough everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to\r\ngratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at\r\nher friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.\r\nWhen Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be\r\nashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her\r\neye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but\r\nin general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to\r\nadmire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to\r\nthe fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had\r\nhappened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the\r\ngarden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of\r\nwhich he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most\r\nrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance\r\nwith which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and\r\nowned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way\r\nthrough every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an\r\ninterval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out\r\nwith a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the\r\nfields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in\r\nthe most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\r\nthe country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the\r\nprospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered\r\nthe park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome\r\nmodern building, well situated on rising ground.", "From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;\r\nbut the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\r\nfrost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\r\ntook her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\r\nprobably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's\r\nhelp. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything\r\nwas fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which\r\nElizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be\r\nforgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by\r\nCharlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\r\nforgotten.", "She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.

She had also to anticipate how her visit\r\nwould pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious\r\ninterruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with\r\nRosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.", "About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready\r\nfor a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in\r\nconfusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running\r\nup stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened\r\nthe door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with\r\nagitation, cried out--", "%(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,\r\nand down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in\r\nquest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the\r\ngarden gate.", "%(dialogue)s cried Elizabeth. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. %(dialogue)s", "Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation\r\nwith the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was\r\nstationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness\r\nbefore him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that\r\nway.", "At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and\r\nthe others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two\r\ngirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which\r\nCharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked\r\nto dine at Rosings the next day.", "", "Chapter 29", "\r\nMr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.\r\nThe power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering\r\nvisitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his\r\nwife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity\r\nof doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady\r\nCatherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.", "%(dialogue)s said he, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Sir William,\r\n%(dialogue)s", "Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their\r\nvisit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what\r\nthey were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and\r\nso splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.", "When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--", "%(dialogue)s", "While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different\r\ndoors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much\r\nobjected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of\r\nher ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas\r\nwho had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her\r\nintroduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done\r\nto his presentation at St. James's.", "As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a\r\nmile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\r\nElizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\r\nraptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\r\nslightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\r\nhouse, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\r\ncost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.", "When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every\r\nmoment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.\r\nElizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady\r\nCatherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or\r\nmiraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought\r\nshe could witness without trepidation.", "From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\r\nrapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they\r\nfollowed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady\r\nCatherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,\r\nwith great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had\r\nsettled it with her husband that the office of introduction should\r\nbe hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those\r\napologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.", "In spite of having been at St. James's Sir William was so completely\r\nawed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\r\nenough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\r\nand his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\r\nof her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself\r\nquite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her\r\ncomposedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\r\nfeatures, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\r\nconciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her\r\nvisitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by\r\nsilence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,\r\nas marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to\r\nElizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she\r\nbelieved Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.", "When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\r\nshe soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\r\ndaughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her\r\nbeing so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any\r\nlikeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her\r\nfeatures, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\r\nlittle, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance\r\nthere was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\r\nto what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\r\nher eyes.", "After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to\r\nadmire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,\r\nand Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth\r\nlooking at in the summer.", "The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and\r\nall the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had\r\nlikewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her\r\nladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\r\nnothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted\r\nalacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir\r\nWilliam, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law\r\nsaid, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\r\nBut Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and\r\ngave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved\r\na novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth\r\nwas ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated\r\nbetween Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\r\nlistening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\r\ndinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little\r\nMiss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing\r\nshe was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the\r\ngentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.", "When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to\r\nbe done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\r\nintermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\r\nsubject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to\r\nhave her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte's domestic\r\nconcerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as\r\nto the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be\r\nregulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the\r\ncare of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was\r\nbeneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an\r\noccasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse\r\nwith Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\r\nElizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew\r\nthe least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,\r\npretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters\r\nshe had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\r\nthem were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\r\nhad been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been\r\nher mother's maiden name?

Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat\r\ndown to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\r\ntwo girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her\r\nparty. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was\r\nuttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson\r\nexpressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or\r\nhaving too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\r\nother table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes\r\nof the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins\r\nwas employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her\r\nfor every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.\r\nSir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes\r\nand noble names.", "When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,\r\nthe tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,\r\ngratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered\r\nround the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were\r\nto have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by\r\nthe arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\r\nCollins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they departed. As soon\r\nas they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin\r\nto give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for\r\nCharlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her\r\ncommendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy\r\nMr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise\r\ninto his own hands.", "", "Chapter 30", "\r\nSir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long\r\nenough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled,\r\nand of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not\r\noften met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his\r\nmorning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but\r\nwhen he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,\r\nand Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\r\ncousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast\r\nand dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in\r\nreading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,\r\nwhich fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.\r\nElizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer\r\nthe dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a\r\nmore pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent\r\nreason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been\r\nmuch less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and\r\nshe gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.", "From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and\r\nwere indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went\r\nalong, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,\r\nwhich he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened\r\nalmost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and\r\nhad a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\r\nprevailed upon to get out.", "Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and\r\nnot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;\r\nand till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings\r\nto be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many\r\nhours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,\r\nand nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\r\nthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\r\nand advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\r\nof the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\r\naccepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding\r\nout that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.", "Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in\r\ncommission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate\r\nin her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her\r\nby Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to\r\nbe quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the\r\nvillage to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold\r\nthem into harmony and plenty.", "The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\r\nand, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one\r\ncard-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart\r\nof the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living\r\nin the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This,\r\nhowever, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time\r\ncomfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with\r\nCharlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had\r\noften great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she\r\nfrequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was\r\nalong the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was\r\na nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and\r\nwhere she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.", "In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.\r\nEaster was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an\r\naddition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be\r\nimportant. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was\r\nexpected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not\r\nmany of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would\r\nfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and\r\nshe might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him\r\nwere, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently\r\ndestined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest\r\nsatisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\r\nseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\r\nMiss Lucas and herself.", "His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking\r\nthe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,\r\nin order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his\r\nbow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great\r\nintelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his\r\nrespects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for\r\nMr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of\r\nhis uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when\r\nMr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen\r\nthem from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running\r\ninto the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:", "%(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,\r\nbefore their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly\r\nafterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,\r\nwho led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and\r\naddress most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been\r\nused to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual\r\nreserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her\r\nfriend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely\r\ncurtseyed to him without saying a word.", "Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\r\nreadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but\r\nhis cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and\r\ngarden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.\r\nAt length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of\r\nElizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual\r\nway, and after a moment's pause, added:", "%(dialogue)s", "She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see\r\nwhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between\r\nthe Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he\r\nanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The\r\nsubject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went\r\naway.", "", "Chapter 31", "\r\nColonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,\r\nand the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures\r\nof their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they\r\nreceived any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the\r\nhouse, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,\r\nalmost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by\r\nsuch an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\r\ncome there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little\r\nof Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the\r\nParsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen\r\nonly at church.", "The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined\r\nthe party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received\r\nthem civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so\r\nacceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,\r\nalmost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,\r\nmuch more than to any other person in the room.", "Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a\r\nwelcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had\r\nmoreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and\r\ntalked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying\r\nat home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\r\nwell entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much\r\nspirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,\r\nas well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\r\ntowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a\r\nwhile, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not\r\nscruple to call out:", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said he, when no longer able to avoid\r\na reply.", "%(dialogue)s", "Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.", "%(dialogue)s said Lady\r\nCatherine; %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s he replied, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-breeding, and made\r\nno answer.", "When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having\r\npromised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He\r\ndrew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then\r\ntalked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away\r\nfrom her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte\r\nstationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's\r\ncountenance.

All field sports were over. Within doors there\r\nwas Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot\r\nalways be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the\r\npleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the\r\ntwo cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither\r\nalmost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\r\nseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their\r\naunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\r\nhad pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\r\nhim still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\r\nbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her\r\nformer favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw\r\nthere was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,\r\nshe believed he might have the best informed mind.", "But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult\r\nto understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\r\nten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,\r\nit seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice\r\nto propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really\r\nanimated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel\r\nFitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\r\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\r\nher; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect\r\nof love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself\r\nseriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at\r\nRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He\r\ncertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\r\nlook was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\r\ndoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it\r\nseemed nothing but absence of mind.", "She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\r\nbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\r\nCollins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\r\nraising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\r\nopinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would\r\nvanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.", "\r\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying\r\nColonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he\r\ncertainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\r\nto counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage\r\nin the church, and his cousin could have none at all.", "", "Chapter 33", "\r\nMore than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\r\nunexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the\r\nmischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to\r\nprevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that\r\nit was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,\r\ntherefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like\r\nwilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was\r\nnot merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,\r\nbut he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He\r\nnever said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\r\nor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\r\nrencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about\r\nher pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her\r\nopinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of\r\nRosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to\r\nexpect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying\r\n_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel\r\nFitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must\r\nmean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed\r\nher a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the\r\npales opposite the Parsonage.", "She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last letter,\r\nand dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in\r\nspirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw\r\non looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.

There, shut into her own room,\r\nas soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption\r\nof all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other\r\npeople could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There\r\ncould not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have\r\nsuch boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures\r\ntaken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had\r\nalways attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement\r\nof them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was\r\nthe cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had\r\nsuffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while\r\nevery hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the\r\nworld; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.", "%(dialogue)s were Colonel\r\nFitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections probably were, her\r\nhaving one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in\r\nbusiness in London.", "%(dialogue)s she exclaimed, %(dialogue)s When she thought of\r\nher mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow\r\nthat any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose\r\npride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of\r\nimportance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense;\r\nand she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed\r\nby this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.\r\nBingley for his sister.", "The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a\r\nheadache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to\r\nher unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her\r\ncousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,\r\nseeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much\r\nas possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins\r\ncould not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather\r\ndispleased by her staying at home.", "", "Chapter 34", "\r\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself\r\nas much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the\r\nexamination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her\r\nbeing in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any\r\nrevival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\r\nBut in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\r\ncheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,\r\nproceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly\r\ndisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth\r\nnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\r\nattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's\r\nshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her\r\na keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation\r\nto think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the\r\nnext--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should\r\nherself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of\r\nher spirits, by all that affection could do.", "She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that\r\nhis cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear\r\nthat he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not\r\nmean to be unhappy about him.", "While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\r\ndoor-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its\r\nbeing Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\r\nthe evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.\r\nBut this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently\r\naffected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\r\nroom. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her\r\nhealth, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\r\nShe answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and\r\nthen getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but\r\nsaid not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her\r\nin an agitated manner, and thus began:", "%(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.

He spoke well; but there were feelings besides\r\nthose of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the\r\nsubject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of\r\nits being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always\r\nopposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to\r\nthe consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his\r\nsuit.", "In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\r\nthe compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did\r\nnot vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\r\nreceive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she\r\nlost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\r\nanswer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\r\nrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite\r\nof all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with\r\nexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\r\nhis hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt\r\nof a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but\r\nhis countenance expressed real security.

She knew not how\r\nto support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for\r\nhalf-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,\r\nwas increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of\r\nmarriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for\r\nso many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of\r\nall the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying\r\nher sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his\r\nown case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired\r\nunconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable\r\npride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to\r\nJane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could\r\nnot justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.\r\nWickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon\r\novercame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for\r\na moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the\r\nsound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to\r\nencounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.", "", "Chapter 35", "\r\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations\r\nwhich had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the\r\nsurprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything\r\nelse; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after\r\nbreakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding\r\ndirectly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's\r\nsometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\r\nshe turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The\r\npark paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one\r\nof the gates into the ground.", "After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\r\ntempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\r\nlook into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had\r\nmade a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\r\nverdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,\r\nwhen she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which\r\nedged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.\r\nDarcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now\r\nnear enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced\r\nher name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though\r\nin a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the\r\ngate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,\r\nwhich she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,\r\n%(dialogue)s And then, with a\r\nslight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.", "With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\r\nElizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,\r\nperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written\r\nquite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise\r\nfull. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\r\nfrom Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--", "\"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension\r\nof its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those\r\noffers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any\r\nintention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes\r\nwhich, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\r\neffort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,\r\nshould have been spared, had not my character required it to be written\r\nand read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\r\nyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I\r\ndemand it of your justice.", "\"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\r\nmagnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,\r\nthat, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley\r\nfrom your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various\r\nclaims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate\r\nprosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and\r\nwantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\r\nfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\r\ndependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect\r\nits exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young\r\npersons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could\r\nbear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last\r\nnight so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope\r\nto be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions\r\nand their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which\r\nis due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which\r\nmay be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity\r\nmust be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.", "\"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with\r\nothers, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young\r\nwoman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance\r\nat Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious\r\nattachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I\r\nhad the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir\r\nWilliam Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to\r\nyour sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.\r\nHe spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could\r\nbe undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour\r\nattentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss\r\nBennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also\r\nwatched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,\r\nbut without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced\r\nfrom the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions\r\nwith pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of\r\nsentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been\r\nin error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter\r\nprobable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict\r\npain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not\r\nscruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and\r\nair was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction\r\nthat, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be\r\neasily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is\r\ncertain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions\r\nare not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe\r\nher to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial\r\nconviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the\r\nmarriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have\r\nthe utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of\r\nconnection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But\r\nthere were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still\r\nexisting, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had\r\nmyself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before\r\nme. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your\r\nmother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that\r\ntotal want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by\r\nherself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your\r\nfather. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern\r\nfor the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this\r\nrepresentation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to\r\nhave conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,\r\nis praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than\r\nit is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say\r\nfarther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties\r\nwas confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led\r\nme before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\r\nconnection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as\r\nyou, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.", "\"The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness\r\nhad been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was\r\nsoon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in\r\ndetaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in\r\nLondon. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office\r\nof pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I\r\ndescribed, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance\r\nmight have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose\r\nthat it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been\r\nseconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your\r\nsister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his\r\naffection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great\r\nnatural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his\r\nown. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was\r\nno very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into\r\nHertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the\r\nwork of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There\r\nis but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not\r\nreflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the\r\nmeasures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in\r\ntown. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her\r\nbrother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without\r\nill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me\r\nenough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this\r\nconcealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it\r\nwas done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no\r\nother apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it\r\nwas unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to\r\nyou very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn\r\nthem.", "\"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured\r\nMr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his\r\nconnection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I\r\nam ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more\r\nthan one witness of undoubted veracity.", "\"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many\r\nyears the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good\r\nconduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to\r\nbe of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his\r\nkindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at\r\nschool, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his\r\nown father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have\r\nbeen unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only\r\nfond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he\r\nhad also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be\r\nhis profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is\r\nmany, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different\r\nmanner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was\r\ncareful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape\r\nthe observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,\r\nand who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.\r\nDarcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree\r\nyou only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham\r\nhas created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from\r\nunfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.", "\"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to\r\nMr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly\r\nrecommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner\r\nthat his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a\r\nvaluable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There\r\nwas also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long\r\nsurvive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham\r\nwrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,\r\nhe hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more\r\nimmediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he\r\ncould not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying\r\nlaw, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would\r\nbe a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed\r\nhim to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to\r\nhis proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the\r\nbusiness was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance\r\nin the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\r\nreceive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\r\nbetween us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\r\nto Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly\r\nlived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free\r\nfrom all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.\r\nFor about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the\r\nincumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to\r\nme again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured\r\nme, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He\r\nhad found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely\r\nresolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in\r\nquestion--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was\r\nwell assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not\r\nhave forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame\r\nme for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every\r\nrepetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of\r\nhis circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me\r\nto others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every\r\nappearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But\r\nlast summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.", "\"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,\r\nand which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold\r\nto any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your\r\nsecrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to\r\nthe guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.\r\nAbout a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed\r\nfor her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided\r\nover it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by\r\ndesign; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him\r\nand Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and\r\nby her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,\r\nwhose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to\r\nher as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and\r\nto consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her\r\nexcuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed\r\nthe knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two\r\nbefore the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the\r\nidea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as\r\na father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and\r\nhow I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented\r\nany public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place\r\nimmediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.\r\nWickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which\r\nis thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of\r\nrevenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have\r\nbeen complete indeed.", "\"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have\r\nbeen concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as\r\nfalse, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.\r\nWickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he\r\nhad imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered\r\nat. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,\r\ndetection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in\r\nyour inclination.", "\"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but\r\nI was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to\r\nbe revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more\r\nparticularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our\r\nnear relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of\r\nthe executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted\r\nwith every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_\r\nshould make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by\r\nthe same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be\r\nthe possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some\r\nopportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the\r\nmorning. I will only add, God bless you.", "%(dialogue)s", "", "Chapter 36", "\r\nIf Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to\r\ncontain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of\r\nits contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly\r\nshe went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.\r\nHer feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did\r\nshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;\r\nand steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation\r\nto give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong\r\nprejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what\r\nhad happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly\r\nleft her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the\r\nnext sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of\r\nthe one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility she\r\ninstantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst\r\nobjections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing\r\nhim justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied\r\nher; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and\r\ninsolence.", "But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when\r\nshe read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,\r\nif true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which\r\nbore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her\r\nfeelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\r\nAstonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished\r\nto discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, %(dialogue)s--and when she had\r\ngone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the\r\nlast page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not\r\nregard it, that she would never look in it again.", "In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\r\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter\r\nwas unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she\r\nagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and\r\ncommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.\r\nThe account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what\r\nhe had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though\r\nshe had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own\r\nwords. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the\r\nwill, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living\r\nwas fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was\r\nimpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\r\nother; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did\r\nnot err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the\r\nparticulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions\r\nto the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\r\nthousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down\r\nthe letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\r\nimpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with\r\nlittle success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read\r\non; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had\r\nbelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to\r\nrender Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a\r\nturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.", "The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at\r\nMr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could\r\nbring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his\r\nentrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the\r\npersuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,\r\nhad there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life\r\nnothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As\r\nto his real character, had information been in her power, she had\r\nnever felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had\r\nestablished him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried\r\nto recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of\r\nintegrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of\r\nMr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those\r\ncasual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy\r\nhad described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But\r\nno such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before\r\nher, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more\r\nsubstantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and\r\nthe regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After\r\npausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to\r\nread. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss\r\nDarcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel\r\nFitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was\r\nreferred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam\r\nhimself--from whom she had previously received the information of his\r\nnear concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no\r\nreason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to\r\nhim, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and\r\nat length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never\r\nhave hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his\r\ncousin's corroboration.", "She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation\r\nbetween Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's.\r\nMany of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_\r\nstruck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and\r\nwondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting\r\nhimself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions\r\nwith his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\r\nof seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that\r\n_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball\r\nthe very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield\r\nfamily had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\r\nherself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;\r\nthat he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's\r\ncharacter, though he had assured her that respect for the father would\r\nalways prevent his exposing the son.", "How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!\r\nHis attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and\r\nhatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer\r\nthe moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.\r\nHis behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had\r\neither been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\r\nhis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most\r\nincautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter\r\nand fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not\r\nbut allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago\r\nasserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as\r\nwere his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\r\nacquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much\r\ntogether, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything\r\nthat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him\r\nof irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was\r\nesteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a\r\nbrother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his\r\nsister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his\r\nactions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of\r\neverything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\r\nthat friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man\r\nas Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.", "She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham\r\ncould she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,\r\nabsurd.", "%(dialogue)s she cried; %(dialogue)s", "From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line\r\nwhich soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation\r\n_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely\r\ndifferent was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that\r\ncredit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to\r\ngive in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her\r\nsister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's\r\nopinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his\r\ndescription of Jane. She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were\r\nlittle displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air\r\nand manner not often united with great sensibility.", "When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\r\nmentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense\r\nof shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly\r\nfor denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as\r\nhaving passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first\r\ndisapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind\r\nthan on hers.", "The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,\r\nbut it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been\r\nself-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered\r\nthat Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest\r\nrelations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt\r\nby such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she\r\nhad ever known before.", "After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every\r\nvariety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,\r\nand reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and\r\nso important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made\r\nher at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish\r\nof appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such\r\nreflections as must make her unfit for conversation.", "She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each\r\ncalled during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take\r\nleave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least\r\nan hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her\r\ntill she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern\r\nin missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no\r\nlonger an object; she could think only of her letter.", "", "Chapter 37", "\r\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having\r\nbeen in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was\r\nable to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very\r\ngood health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the\r\nmelancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then\r\nhastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return\r\nbrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,\r\nimporting that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of\r\nhaving them all to dine with her.", "Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had\r\nshe chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as\r\nher future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her\r\nladyship's indignation would have been. %(dialogue)s were questions with which she amused herself.", "Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. %(dialogue)s said Lady Catherine; %(dialogue)s", "Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which\r\nwere kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.", "Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of\r\nspirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that\r\nshe did not like to go home again so soon, she added:", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied\r\nElizabeth, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "Lady Catherine seemed resigned. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,\r\nand as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,\r\nwhich Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so\r\noccupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be\r\nreserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it\r\nas the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary\r\nwalk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant\r\nrecollections.", "Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She\r\nstudied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at\r\ntimes widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,\r\nshe was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly\r\nshe had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against\r\nherself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.\r\nHis attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she\r\ncould not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,\r\nor feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past\r\nbehaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in\r\nthe unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.\r\nThey were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at\r\nthem, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his\r\nyoungest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right\r\nherself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently\r\nunited with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine\r\nand Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,\r\nwhat chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,\r\nirritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always\r\naffronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would\r\nscarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain.

She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general\r\nbehaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of\r\nsuch a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\r\nimprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must\r\nbe greater than at home.

In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised\r\nevery possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye\r\nof fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.\r\nShe saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them\r\nat present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents\r\nstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young\r\nand the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she\r\nsaw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six\r\nofficers at once.", "Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such\r\nrealities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have\r\nbeen understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.\r\nLydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy\r\nconviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.", "But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures\r\ncontinued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leaving\r\nhome.", "Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been\r\nfrequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty\r\nwell over; the agitations of formal partiality entirely so. She had even\r\nlearnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted\r\nher, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present\r\nbehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,\r\nfor the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which\r\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after\r\nwhat had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in\r\nfinding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous\r\ngallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the\r\nreproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever\r\ncause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,\r\nand her preference secured at any time by their renewal.", "On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he dined,\r\nwith other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth\r\ndisposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some\r\ninquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she\r\nmentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three\r\nweeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.", "He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's\r\nrecollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen\r\nhim often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,\r\nasked her how she had liked him.

There was a\r\nsomething in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive\r\nand anxious attention, while she added:", "%(dialogue)s", "Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated\r\nlook; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his\r\nembarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of\r\naccents:", "%(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a\r\nslight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on\r\nthe old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge\r\nhim. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his\r\nside, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish\r\nElizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a\r\nmutual desire of never meeting again.", "When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,\r\nfrom whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation\r\nbetween her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the\r\nonly one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.\r\nBennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,\r\nand impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the\r\nopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which\r\nthere was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in\r\nthe clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more\r\ngentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.", "", "Chapter 42", "\r\nHad Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could\r\nnot have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic\r\ncomfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance\r\nof good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a\r\nwoman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in\r\ntheir marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,\r\nesteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views\r\nof domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of\r\na disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own\r\nimprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often\r\nconsole the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of\r\nthe country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal\r\nenjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as\r\nher ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not\r\nthe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his\r\nwife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\r\nphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.", "Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her\r\nfather's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but\r\nrespecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of\r\nherself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\r\nbanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation\r\nand decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own\r\nchildren, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so\r\nstrongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so\r\nunsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising\r\nfrom so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,\r\nmight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even\r\nif incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.", "When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found little\r\nother cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties\r\nabroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and\r\nsister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around\r\nthem threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty\r\nmight in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers\r\nof her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition\r\ngreater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all\r\nher folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a\r\nwatering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what\r\nhas been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been\r\nlooking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the\r\nsatisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to\r\nname some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have\r\nsome other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by\r\nagain enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the\r\npresent, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes\r\nwas now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation\r\nfor all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother\r\nand Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the\r\nscheme, every part of it would have been perfect.", "%(dialogue)s thought she, %(dialogue)s", "When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely\r\nto her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and\r\nalways very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that\r\nthey were just returned from the library, where such and such officers\r\nhad attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as\r\nmade her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\r\nshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\r\nviolent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to\r\nthe camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still\r\nless to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were\r\nmuch too full of lines under the words to be made public.", "After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good\r\nhumour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore\r\na happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came\r\nback again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet\r\nwas restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of\r\nJune, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without\r\ntears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by\r\nthe following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to\r\nmention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious\r\narrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in\r\nMeryton.", "The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast\r\napproaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter\r\narrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and\r\ncurtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from\r\nsetting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again\r\nwithin a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so\r\nfar, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\r\nthe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\r\nthe Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the\r\npresent plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that\r\ncounty there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three\r\nweeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The\r\ntown where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\r\nthey were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of\r\nher curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\r\nDovedale, or the Peak.", "Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing\r\nthe Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it\r\nwas her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;\r\nand all was soon right again.", "With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was\r\nimpossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its\r\nowner. %(dialogue)s said she, %(dialogue)s", "The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away\r\nbefore her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at\r\nLongbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two\r\nyounger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their\r\ncousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and\r\nsweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every\r\nway--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.", "The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the\r\nnext morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.\r\nOne enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;\r\na suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\r\ninconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection\r\nand intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were\r\ndisappointments abroad.", "It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,\r\nnor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither\r\nlay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are\r\nsufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present\r\nconcern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's\r\nformer residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance\r\nstill remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the\r\nprincipal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,\r\nElizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not\r\nin their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In\r\ntalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed\r\nan inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\r\nwillingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.", "%(dialogue)s said her aunt; %(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\r\nPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She\r\nmust own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so\r\nmany, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.", "Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. %(dialogue)s said she, %(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The\r\npossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly\r\noccurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and\r\nthought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such\r\na risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved\r\nthat it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the\r\nabsence of the family were unfavourably answered.", "Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\r\nwhether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its\r\nproprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for\r\nthe summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her\r\nalarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\r\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\r\nnext morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\r\nwith a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\r\nto the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.", "", "Chapter 43", "\r\nElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of\r\nPemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned\r\nin at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.", "The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They\r\nentered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through\r\na beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.", "Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired\r\nevery remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for\r\nhalf-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable\r\neminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by\r\nPemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which\r\nthe road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone\r\nbuilding, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of\r\nhigh woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was\r\nswelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\r\nwere neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\r\nhad never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\r\nbeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\r\nall of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that\r\nto be mistress of Pemberley might be something!", "They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\r\nwhile examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of\r\nmeeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\r\nmistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\r\nhall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\r\nwonder at her being where she was.", "The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less\r\nfine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They\r\nfollowed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned\r\nroom, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\r\nto a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which\r\nthey had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,\r\nwas a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and\r\nshe looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its\r\nbanks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,\r\nwith delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking\r\ndifferent positions; but from every window there were beauties to be\r\nseen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to\r\nthe fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of\r\nhis taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of\r\nsplendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.", "%(dialogue)s thought she, %(dialogue)s--recollecting\r\nherself--%(dialogue)s", "This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like\r\nregret.", "She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really\r\nabsent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question\r\nwas asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.\r\nReynolds replied that he was, adding, %(dialogue)s How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own\r\njourney had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!", "Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the\r\nlikeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,\r\nover the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.\r\nThe housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young\r\ngentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought\r\nup by him at his own expense. %(dialogue)s she added;\r\n%(dialogue)s", "Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\r\nreturn it.", "%(dialogue)s said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\r\n%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Mrs. Gardiner,\r\nlooking at the picture; %(dialogue)s", "Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\r\nintimation of her knowing her master.", "%(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth coloured, and said: %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.", "Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\r\nwhen she was only eight years old.", "%(dialogue)s said Mrs. Gardiner.", "%(dialogue)s", "Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her\r\ncommunicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either\r\nby pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\r\nmaster and his sister.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s thought Elizabeth, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s\r\nreplied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she\r\nlistened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, %(dialogue)s", "This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her\r\nideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\r\nHer keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was\r\ngrateful to her uncle for saying:", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth almost stared at her. %(dialogue)s thought she.", "%(dialogue)s said Mrs. Gardiner.", "%(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.\r\nReynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects\r\nof the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\r\nfurniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\r\nprejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\r\nmaster, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\r\nmany merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.", "%(dialogue)s said she, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s thought Elizabeth.", "%(dialogue)s whispered her aunt as they walked, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty\r\nsitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than\r\nthe apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to\r\ngive pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when\r\nlast at Pemberley.", "%(dialogue)s said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\r\none of the windows.", "Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter\r\nthe room. %(dialogue)s she added. %(dialogue)s", "The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were\r\nall that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;\r\nbut Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\r\nvisible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\r\nDarcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\r\nalso more intelligible.", "In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\r\nlittle to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of\r\nthe only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested\r\nher--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a\r\nsmile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he\r\nlooked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest\r\ncontemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.\r\nMrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's\r\nlifetime.", "There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle\r\nsensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of\r\ntheir acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\r\nwas of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\r\nof an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\r\nconsidered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how\r\nmuch of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of\r\ngood or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought\r\nforward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\r\nstood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his\r\neyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of\r\ngratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and\r\nsoftened its impropriety of expression.", "When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\r\nthey returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were\r\nconsigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.", "As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\r\nto look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former\r\nwas conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\r\nsuddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.", "They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his\r\nappearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\r\ninstantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest\r\nblush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\r\nsurprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\r\nand spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\r\nof perfect civility.", "She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\r\nreceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\r\novercome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\r\nthey had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\r\nthat they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on\r\nbeholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\r\naloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\r\nscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer\r\nshe returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the\r\nalteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that\r\nhe uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\r\nimpropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\r\nminutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in\r\nher life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent\r\nhad none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as\r\nto the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in\r\nDerbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\r\ndistraction of his thoughts.", "At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few\r\nmoments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\r\nleave.", "The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but\r\nElizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,\r\nfollowed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her\r\ncoming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the\r\nworld! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light\r\nmight it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely\r\nthrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he\r\nthus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes\r\nsooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;\r\nfor it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted\r\nfrom his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over\r\nthe perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly\r\naltered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was\r\namazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!\r\nNever in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never\r\nhad he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What\r\na contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put\r\nhis letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account\r\nfor it.", "They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\r\nevery step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\r\nreach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time\r\nbefore Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\r\nmechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and\r\nseemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\r\ndistinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\r\none spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\r\nwas. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in\r\nwhat manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\r\nshe was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he\r\nfelt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was\r\nnot like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in\r\nseeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\r\ncomposure.", "At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\r\naroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.", "They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,\r\nascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of\r\nthe trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the\r\nvalley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading\r\nmany, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish\r\nof going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.\r\nWith a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.\r\nIt settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which\r\nbrought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,\r\nto the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed\r\nit by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;\r\nit was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the\r\nvalley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,\r\nand a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.\r\nElizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the\r\nbridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\r\nwho was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only\r\nof returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\r\ntherefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\r\non the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\r\nprogress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\r\ntaste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\r\noccasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the\r\nman about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\r\nslow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment\r\nwas quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\r\napproaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here\r\nless sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\r\nthey met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared\r\nfor an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\r\ncalmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\r\nshe felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea\r\nlasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\r\nturning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw\r\nthat he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\r\npoliteness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;\r\nbut she had not got beyond the words %(dialogue)s and %(dialogue)s when\r\nsome unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of\r\nPemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,\r\nand she said no more.", "Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\r\nher if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\r\nThis was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;\r\nand she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the\r\nacquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had\r\nrevolted in his offer to herself. %(dialogue)s thought\r\nshe, %(dialogue)s", "The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\r\nrelationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\r\nit, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\r\ncould from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\r\nconnection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and\r\nso far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\r\nconversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\r\ncould not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had\r\nsome relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\r\nattentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\r\nexpression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\r\nhis taste, or his good manners.", "The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\r\ninvite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\r\nchose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time\r\nto supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\r\nthe stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\r\nwalking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.\r\nElizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment\r\nmust be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and\r\ncontinually was she repeating, %(dialogue)s", "After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\r\ngentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to\r\nthe brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\r\nwater-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated\r\nin Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\r\nElizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\r\nher husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\r\ntogether. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him\r\nto know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\r\nplace, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\r\nvery unexpected--%(dialogue)s she added, %(dialogue)s He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that\r\nbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\r\nbefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. %(dialogue)s he continued, %(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\r\ndriven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last\r\nmentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_\r\nmind was not very differently engaged.", "%(dialogue)s he continued after a\r\npause, %(dialogue)s", "The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\r\nfor her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt\r\nthat whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her\r\nmust be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was\r\nsatisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\r\nhim think really ill of her.", "They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth\r\nwas not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\r\npleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of\r\nthe highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had\r\nreached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\r\nmile behind.", "He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not\r\ntired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might\r\nhave been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\r\nthere seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected\r\nthat she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale\r\nwith great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her\r\npatience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was\r\nover. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go\r\ninto the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and\r\nthey parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the\r\nladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\r\nwalking slowly towards the house.", "The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\r\npronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.\r\n%(dialogue)s said her uncle.", "%(dialogue)s replied her\r\naunt, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said her aunt, %(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked\r\nhim better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never\r\nseen him so pleasant as this morning.", "%(dialogue)s replied\r\nher uncle. %(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but\r\nsaid nothing.", "%(dialogue)s continued Mrs. Gardiner, %(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\r\nhis behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in\r\nas guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from\r\nhis relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\r\nconstruction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\r\nWickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In\r\nconfirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\r\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\r\nher authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.", "Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now\r\napproaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\r\nthe charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\r\nto her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of\r\nanything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they\r\nhad no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\r\nacquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a\r\nintercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.", "The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\r\nmuch attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\r\nbut think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above\r\nall, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.", "", "Chapter 44", "\r\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit\r\nher the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently\r\nresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\r\nBut her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their\r\narrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the\r\nplace with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn\r\nto dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\r\ncarriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in\r\na curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing\r\nthe livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her\r\nsurprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she\r\nexpected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\r\nof her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\r\nof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\r\nthe business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that\r\nthere was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a\r\nquarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\r\nnewly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\r\nElizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite\r\namazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,\r\nshe dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much\r\nin her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\r\nsuspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.", "She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\r\nup and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of\r\ninquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.", "Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\r\ntook place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\r\nacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\r\nbeing at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\r\nbut the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\r\nonly exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\r\nher beyond a monosyllable.", "Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\r\nlittle more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\r\nwomanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there\r\nwas sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\r\nunassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\r\nacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\r\nrelieved by discerning such different feelings.", "They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley\r\nwas also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\r\nsatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick\r\nstep was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\r\nElizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\r\nfelt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\r\ncordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He\r\ninquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked\r\nand spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.", "To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\r\nthan to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\r\nthem, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just\r\narisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards\r\neach with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from\r\nthose inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew\r\nwhat it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little\r\nin doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\r\nevident enough.", "Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\r\nfeelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and\r\nto make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\r\nfeared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she\r\nendeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley\r\nwas ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.", "In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!\r\nhow ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in\r\na like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on\r\nformer occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion\r\nthat, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,\r\nthough this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his\r\nbehaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look\r\nappeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred\r\nbetween them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point\r\nshe was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred\r\nere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a\r\nrecollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying\r\nmore that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed\r\nto her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone\r\nwhich had something of real regret, that it %(dialogue)s and, before she could reply,\r\nhe added, %(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\r\ntook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether\r\n_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,\r\nnor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which\r\ngave them meaning.", "It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;\r\nbut, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general\r\ncomplaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed\r\nfrom _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that\r\nthe improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however\r\ntemporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When\r\nshe saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion\r\nof people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a\r\ndisgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the\r\nvery relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last\r\nlively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was\r\nso great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly\r\nrestrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company\r\nof his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations\r\nat Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\r\nself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance\r\ncould result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\r\nacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw\r\ndown the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\r\nRosings.", "Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose\r\nto depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing\r\ntheir wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner\r\nat Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a\r\ndiffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\r\nreadily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\r\nhow _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\r\nacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,\r\nthat this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than\r\nany dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\r\nsociety, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\r\nher attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.", "Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\r\nagain, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to\r\nmake after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\r\nthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on\r\nthis account, as well as some others, found herself, when their\r\nvisitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some\r\nsatisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been\r\nlittle. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her\r\nuncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\r\nfavourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.", "But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was\r\nnot their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was\r\nmuch better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\r\nit was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\r\ninterest, but nothing to justify inquiry.", "Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\r\nas their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\r\nnot be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\r\nfrom their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference\r\nto any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\r\nwould not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\r\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible\r\nthat the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four\r\nyears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\r\nhastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\r\ntheir Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had\r\nnothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,\r\nit would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town\r\nwhere the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he\r\nwas a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.", "With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\r\nthere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the\r\nson of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known\r\nfact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\r\nhim, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.", "As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\r\nthe last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\r\nlong enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;\r\nand she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She\r\ncertainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\r\nhad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\r\nthat could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\r\nvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\r\ntime ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened\r\ninto somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in\r\nhis favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\r\nwhich yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\r\nthere was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.\r\nIt was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,\r\nbut for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and\r\nacrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations\r\naccompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid\r\nher as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most\r\neager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display\r\nof regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only\r\nwere concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent\r\non making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much\r\npride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent\r\nlove, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a\r\nsort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be\r\nexactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,\r\nshe felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how\r\nfar she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would\r\nbe for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her\r\nfancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of\r\nhis addresses.", "It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that\r\nsuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the\r\nvery day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a\r\nlate breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,\r\nby some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that\r\nit would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\r\nmorning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when\r\nshe asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.", "Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been\r\nrenewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting\r\nsome of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.", "", "Chapter 45", "\r\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had\r\noriginated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her\r\nappearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how\r\nmuch civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.", "On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,\r\nwhose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows\r\nopening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\r\nhills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts\r\nwhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.", "In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\r\nwith Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\r\nLondon. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with\r\nall the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear\r\nof doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior\r\nthe belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,\r\nhowever, did her justice, and pitied her.", "By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,\r\non their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\r\nsucceeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\r\ngenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\r\nof discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the\r\nothers; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\r\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\r\nwished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\r\nshort sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.", "Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\r\nand that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\r\ncalling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\r\nfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\r\ninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\r\nof saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\r\nmoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she\r\nfeared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\r\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\r\nsitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss\r\nBingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\r\ninquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\r\nindifference and brevity, and the other said no more.", "The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\r\nentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\r\nfinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many\r\na significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\r\ngiven, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\r\nparty--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\r\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected\r\nthem round the table.", "While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\r\nshe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\r\nfeelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\r\na moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\r\nregret that he came.", "He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\r\ngentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him\r\nonly on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\r\nGeorgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely\r\nresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more\r\nnecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\r\nsaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\r\nand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\r\nwhen he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\r\ncuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the\r\nsmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\r\nobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\r\nto Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's\r\nentrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he\r\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded\r\nas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\r\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\r\nfirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:", "%(dialogue)s", "In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth\r\ninstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\r\nvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;\r\nbut exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\r\npresently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While\r\nshe spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened\r\ncomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\r\nconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\r\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would\r\nhave refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\r\nElizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\r\nher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\r\nDarcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies\r\nand absurdities by which some part of her family were connected\r\nwith that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's\r\nmeditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\r\nwas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections\r\nher brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very\r\nwish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\r\nhereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without\r\nmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\r\nBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\r\nfor the welfare of his friend.", "Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\r\nas Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\r\nWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\r\nto speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\r\nrecollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which\r\nhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have\r\nfixed them on her more and more cheerfully.", "Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above\r\nmentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss\r\nBingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person,\r\nbehaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's\r\nrecommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not\r\nerr. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana\r\nwithout the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When\r\nDarcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to\r\nhim some part of what she had been saying to his sister.", "%(dialogue)s she\r\ncried; %(dialogue)s", "However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\r\nhimself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than\r\nher being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\r\nsummer.", "%(dialogue)s she rejoined, %(dialogue)s", "Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not\r\nthe best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always\r\nwise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\r\nsuccess she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a\r\ndetermination of making him speak, she continued:", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, %(dialogue)s", "He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of\r\nhaving forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.", "Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their\r\nvisit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them\r\nboth. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,\r\nexcept of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked\r\nof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but\r\nhimself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of\r\nhim, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's\r\nbeginning the subject.", "", "Chapter 46", "\r\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from\r\nJane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been\r\nrenewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but\r\non the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the\r\nreceipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that\r\nit had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as\r\nJane had written the direction remarkably ill.", "They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and\r\nher uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by\r\nthemselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been\r\nwritten five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their\r\nlittle parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;\r\nbut the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident\r\nagitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:", "%(dialogue)s", "Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing\r\nwhat she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the\r\nother, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it\r\nhad been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\r\nas she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing\r\na moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was\r\nopened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous\r\nmanner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,\r\nshe, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation,\r\nhastily exclaimed, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s cried he, with more feeling than\r\npoliteness; then recollecting himself, %(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how\r\nlittle would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back\r\nthe servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless\r\nan accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and\r\nmistress home instantly.", "On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and\r\nlooking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,\r\nor to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,\r\n%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. %(dialogue)s", "She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could\r\nnot speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say\r\nsomething indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate\r\nsilence. At length she spoke again. %(dialogue)s", "Darcy was fixed in astonishment. %(dialogue)s she added in a yet\r\nmore agitated voice, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s cried Darcy; %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.", "%(dialogue)s", "Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking\r\nup and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air\r\ngloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her\r\npower was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family\r\nweakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither\r\nwonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\r\nconsolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It\r\nwas, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\r\nwishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\r\nhim, as now, when all love must be vain.", "But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the\r\nhumiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed\r\nup every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\r\nElizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of\r\nseveral minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by\r\nthe voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke\r\ncompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for\r\nher distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\r\nreason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only\r\none serious, parting look, went away.", "As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\r\nshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as\r\nhad marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\r\nretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full\r\nof contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\r\nfeelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\r\nformerly have rejoiced in its termination.", "If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's\r\nchange of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if\r\notherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\r\nunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on\r\na first interview with its object, and even before two words have been\r\nexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\r\nsomewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,\r\nand that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other\r\nless interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him\r\ngo with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must\r\nproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\r\nbusiness. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained\r\na hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\r\ncould flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\r\nof her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first\r\nletter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that\r\nWickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry\r\nfor money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\r\nincomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\r\nas this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose\r\nLydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention\r\nof marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue\r\nnor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.", "She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\r\nLydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia\r\nwanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one\r\nofficer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions\r\nraised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been\r\nfluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\r\nmistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now\r\nfeel it!", "She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to\r\nshare with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\r\nfamily so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\r\nrequiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\r\ncould be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost\r\nimportance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's\r\naccount that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them\r\ninstantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their\r\nsummons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript\r\nof the last with trembling energy, though Lydia had never been a\r\nfavourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply\r\nafflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the\r\nfirst exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every\r\nassistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked\r\nhim with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,\r\neverything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to\r\nbe off as soon as possible. %(dialogue)s\r\ncried Mrs. Gardiner. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s repeated the other, as she ran into her room to\r\nprepare. %(dialogue)s", "But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the\r\nhurry and confusion of the following hour.

An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\r\nGardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing\r\nremained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\r\nthe morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\r\nhave supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.", "", "Chapter 47", "\r\n%(dialogue)s said her uncle, as they\r\ndrove from the town; %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.", "%(dialogue)s said Mrs. Gardiner, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Mr. Gardiner, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Elizabeth, with\r\ntears in her eyes, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said her aunt, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity\r\nas to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.", "%(dialogue)s replied Elizabeth, colouring. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "                          * * * * *", "It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added\r\nto their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by\r\nits repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during\r\nthe whole of the journey.

It was a\r\ncomfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied\r\nby long expectations.", "The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\r\non the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the\r\ncarriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their\r\nfaces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\r\ncapers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.", "Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,\r\nhurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her\r\nmother's apartment, immediately met her.", "Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the\r\neyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been\r\nheard of the fugitives.", "%(dialogue)s replied Jane. %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s cried Elizabeth. %(dialogue)s", "Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their\r\nconversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were\r\nengaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach\r\nof the whole party.

The sanguine hope of\r\ngood, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet\r\ndeserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that\r\nevery morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,\r\nto explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.", "Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes'\r\nconversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with\r\ntears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous\r\nconduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;\r\nblaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the\r\nerrors of her daughter must principally be owing.", "%(dialogue)s said she, %(dialogue)s", "They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after\r\ngeneral assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her\r\nthat he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.\r\nBennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.", "%(dialogue)s added he; %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Mrs. Bennet, %(dialogue)s", "But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours\r\nin the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well\r\nin her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till\r\ndinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on\r\nthe housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.", "Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real\r\noccasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to\r\noppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her\r\ntongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it\r\nbetter that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could\r\nmost trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the\r\nsubject.", "In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been\r\ntoo busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance\r\nbefore.

Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself\r\nsincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in\r\nyour present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because\r\nproceeding from a cause which no time can remove.

The death of your daughter would\r\nhave been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to\r\nbe lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte\r\ninforms me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has\r\nproceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,\r\nfor the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think\r\nthat her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be\r\nguilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,\r\nyou are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined\r\nby Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to\r\nwhom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that\r\nthis false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of\r\nall the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,\r\nwill connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads\r\nme moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event\r\nof last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved\r\nin all your sorrow and disgrace.

There was no one, therefore,\r\nwho could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him.

Colonel Forster believed that more than a\r\nthousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.\r\nHe owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more\r\nformidable.

He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that\r\nrespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever\r\nof honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of\r\nprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be\r\nher husband might then have rested in its proper place.", "He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone\r\nshould be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he\r\nwas determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,\r\nand to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.", "When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly\r\nuseless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join\r\nin cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow\r\nand younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters\r\nsuccessively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\r\nBennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he\r\nwould. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then\r\ntoo late to be saving.

But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the\r\nlatter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with\r\nregard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet\r\ncould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In\r\nterms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,\r\nthough expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\r\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\r\nengagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed\r\nthat, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would\r\nbe done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present\r\narrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the\r\nhundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\r\nallowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her\r\nthrough her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within\r\nthat sum.", "That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\r\nanother very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as\r\nlittle trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports\r\nof rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he\r\nnaturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon\r\ndispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick\r\nin its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he\r\nwas indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any\r\nmessage to her.", "The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate\r\nspeed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent\r\nphilosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage\r\nof conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the\r\nhappiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant\r\nfarmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the\r\ngood-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from\r\nall the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit\r\nin this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery\r\nwas considered certain.", "It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this\r\nhappy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in\r\nspirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her\r\ntriumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object\r\nof her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\r\naccomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those\r\nattendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\r\nservants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a\r\nproper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering\r\nwhat their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\r\nimportance.", "%(dialogue)s said she, %(dialogue)s", "Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the\r\nservants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: %(dialogue)s", "A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It\r\nsoon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,\r\nthat her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\r\ndaughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of\r\naffection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend\r\nit. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\r\nresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her\r\nmarriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe\r\npossible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new\r\nclothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of\r\nshame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they\r\ntook place.", "Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\r\nthe moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for\r\nher sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the\r\nproper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\r\nunfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the\r\nspot.", "She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were\r\nfew people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\r\nbut, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's\r\nfrailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear\r\nof disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,\r\nthere seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been\r\nconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\r\nMr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other\r\nobjection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the\r\nnearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.", "From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The\r\nwish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\r\nfeeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\r\nblow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\r\nhardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no\r\nlonger hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there\r\nseemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that\r\nshe could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they\r\nshould meet.", "What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the\r\nproposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now\r\nhave been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she\r\ndoubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,\r\nthere must be a triumph.", "She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in\r\ndisposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and\r\ntemper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It\r\nwas an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease\r\nand liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;\r\nand from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she\r\nmust have received benefit of greater importance.", "But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what\r\nconnubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and\r\nprecluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their\r\nfamily.", "How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,\r\nshe could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could\r\nbelong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions\r\nwere stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.", "                          * * * * *", "Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's\r\nacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to\r\npromote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties\r\nthat the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal\r\npurport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved\r\non quitting the militia.", "%(dialogue)s he added, \"as soon as\r\nhis marriage was fixed on.

He has the promise of an\r\nensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It\r\nis an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He\r\npromises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each\r\nhave a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have\r\nwritten to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,\r\nand to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham\r\nin and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I\r\nhave pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying\r\nsimilar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin\r\na list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I\r\nhope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,\r\nand all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,\r\nunless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.\r\nGardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she\r\nleaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to\r\nyou and your mother.--Yours, etc.,", "%(dialogue)s", "Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal\r\nfrom the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do.

Lydia's being settled in the North,\r\njust when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,\r\nfor she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in\r\nHertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a\r\npity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted\r\nwith everybody, and had so many favourites.", "%(dialogue)s said she, %(dialogue)s", "His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being\r\nadmitted into her family again before she set off for the North,\r\nreceived at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,\r\nwho agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and\r\nconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,\r\nurged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her\r\nand her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was\r\nprevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their\r\nmother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show\r\nher married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the\r\nNorth. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent\r\nhis permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as\r\nthe ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was\r\nsurprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and\r\nhad she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would\r\nhave been the last object of her wishes.", "", "Chapter 51", "\r\nTheir sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her\r\nprobably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to\r\nmeet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time.

The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive\r\nthem.

Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and\r\nwelcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,\r\nto Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an\r\nalacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.", "Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite\r\nso cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely\r\nopened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was\r\nenough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet\r\nwas shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,\r\nand fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their\r\ncongratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly\r\nround the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and\r\nobserved, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been\r\nthere.", "Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners\r\nwere always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been\r\nexactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he\r\nclaimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had\r\nnot before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,\r\nresolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence\r\nof an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the\r\ntwo who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.", "There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither\r\nof them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near\r\nElizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,\r\nwith a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her\r\nreplies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the\r\nworld. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led\r\nvoluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for\r\nthe world.", "%(dialogue)s she cried, %(dialogue)s", "Her father lifted up his eyes.

These parties were acceptable to\r\nall; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did\r\nthink, than such as did not.", "Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected\r\nto find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her\r\npresent observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that\r\ntheir elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather\r\nthan by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring\r\nfor her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain\r\nthat his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\r\nif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity\r\nof having a companion.", "Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every\r\noccasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every\r\nthing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on\r\nthe first of September, than any body else in the country.", "One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two\r\nelder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Elizabeth; %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Jane, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Lydia, %(dialogue)s", "On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her\r\npower, by running away.", "But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least\r\nit was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at\r\nher sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,\r\nwhere he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.\r\nConjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\r\nbrain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as\r\nplacing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She\r\ncould not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,\r\nwrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\r\nLydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\r\nintended.", "%(dialogue)s she added, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s she added to herself, as she finished\r\nthe letter; %(dialogue)s", "Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\r\nElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad\r\nof it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any\r\nsatisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.", "", "Chapter 52", "\r\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as\r\nsoon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it\r\nthan, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to\r\nbe interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to\r\nbe happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not\r\ncontain a denial.", "\"Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.", "\"MY DEAR NIECE,", "\"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning\r\nto answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise\r\nwhat I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your\r\napplication; I did not expect it from _you_. Don't think me angry,\r\nhowever, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such\r\ninquiries to be necessary on _your_ side. If you do not choose to\r\nunderstand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised\r\nas I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned\r\nwould have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really\r\ninnocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.", "\"On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most\r\nunexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several\r\nhours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so\r\ndreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.\r\nGardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,\r\nand that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,\r\nLydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day\r\nafter ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\r\nthem. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to\r\nhimself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to\r\nmake it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide\r\nin him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and\r\nconfessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private\r\nactions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He\r\ncalled it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy\r\nan evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_\r\nmotive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days\r\nin town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to\r\ndirect his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness\r\nof this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.", "\"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago\r\ngoverness to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause\r\nof disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large\r\nhouse in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting\r\nlodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with\r\nWickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to\r\ntown. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\r\nwanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and\r\ncorruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.\r\nWickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had\r\nshe been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up\r\ntheir abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the\r\nwished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and\r\nafterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he\r\nacknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful\r\nsituation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed\r\non to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But\r\nhe found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared\r\nfor none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear\r\nof leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\r\nother, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,\r\nit only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,\r\nin his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never\r\nbeen _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,\r\non account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and\r\nscrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her\r\nown folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as\r\nto his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He\r\nmust go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have\r\nnothing to live on.", "\"Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though\r\nMr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able\r\nto do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by\r\nmarriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still\r\ncherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in\r\nsome other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely\r\nto be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.", "\"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of\r\ncourse wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be\r\nreasonable.", "\"Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to\r\nmake your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\r\nstreet the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be\r\nseen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was\r\nstill with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge\r\nyour father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your\r\nuncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the\r\ndeparture of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next\r\nday it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.", "\"On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,\r\nand, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.", "\"They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not all\r\nsettled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to\r\nLongbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that\r\nobstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been\r\naccused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.\r\nNothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and\r\nI do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your\r\nuncle would most readily have settled the whole.", "\"They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either\r\nthe gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle\r\nwas forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his\r\nniece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,\r\nwhich went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter\r\nthis morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation\r\nthat would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\r\nit was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane\r\nat most.", "\"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young\r\npeople. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably\r\nmore than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own\r\nsettled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all\r\nthis was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It\r\nwas owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that\r\nWickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he\r\nhad been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth\r\nin _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve,\r\ncan be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,\r\nmy dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would\r\nnever have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another\r\ninterest_ in the affair.", "\"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who\r\nwere still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in\r\nLondon once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were\r\nthen to receive the last finish.", "\"I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which\r\nyou tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not\r\nafford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant\r\nadmission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I\r\nknew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was\r\nsatisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not\r\nperceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming\r\nhome was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell\r\nyou can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most\r\nserious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had\r\ndone, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she\r\nheard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was\r\nsometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and\r\nJane, and for their sakes had patience with her.", "\"Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,\r\nattended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave\r\ntown again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my\r\ndear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\r\nenough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,\r\nin every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His\r\nunderstanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little\r\nmore liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach\r\nhim. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. But\r\nslyness seems the fashion.", "\"Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not\r\npunish me so far as to exclude me from P.

The children have been wanting me this half\r\nhour.", "\"Yours, very sincerely,", "%(dialogue)s", "The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,\r\nin which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the\r\ngreatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had\r\nproduced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's\r\nmatch, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too\r\ngreat to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the\r\npain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!\r\nHe had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all\r\nthe trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which\r\nsupplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and\r\ndespise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason\r\nwith, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to\r\navoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had\r\ndone all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her\r\nheart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly\r\nchecked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity\r\nwas insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for\r\na woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so\r\nnatural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law\r\nof Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,\r\nto be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had\r\ngiven a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary\r\nstretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been\r\nwrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and\r\nthough she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she\r\ncould, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist\r\nhis endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially\r\nconcerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were\r\nunder obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They\r\nowed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!\r\nhow heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever\r\nencouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For\r\nherself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause\r\nof compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.\r\nShe read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again. It\r\nwas hardly enough; but it pleased her.

But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be\r\nsuspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.\r\nGardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.\r\nTo Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,\r\nand whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\r\ninformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted\r\nfor the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\r\ninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as\r\nwhat Jane felt for Bingley.

He\r\nwas not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but\r\nit had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,\r\nwhen he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without\r\nbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist\r\nthe impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often\r\nfound him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but\r\nthe ground.

It drew from her,\r\nhowever, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually\r\ndone before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in\r\nthe country at present. A few weeks, he believed.", "%(dialogue)s said her mother,\r\n%(dialogue)s", "Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious\r\nattention!

When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;\r\nbut every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He\r\nfound her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and\r\nas unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no\r\ndifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\r\nthat she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,\r\nthat she did not always know when she was silent.", "When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her\r\nintended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at\r\nLongbourn in a few days time.", "%(dialogue)s she added, %(dialogue)s", "Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of\r\nhis concern at having been prevented by business.

When they repaired to the\r\ndining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take\r\nthe place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\r\nher sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore\r\nto invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to\r\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\r\ndecided.

Though she dared not depend upon the\r\nconsequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\r\ngave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\r\nno cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table\r\ncould divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\r\nsuch a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\r\nadvantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but\r\nshe could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\r\ncold was their manner whenever they did.

Your daughter\r\nElizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after\r\nher elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may\r\nbe reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in\r\nthis land.'", "%(dialogue)s 'This young\r\ngentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of\r\nmortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive\r\npatronage.

Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by\r\nwhat he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but\r\nwonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of\r\nhis seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.", "", "Chapter 58", "\r\nInstead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as\r\nElizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy\r\nwith him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's\r\nvisit.

The\r\nhappiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never\r\nfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\r\nwarmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.

Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to\r\nAgamemnon's wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew\r\nit would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him not to do\r\neither of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure to take his\r\nrevenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury told him\r\nthis in all good will but he would not listen, and now he has paid for\r\neverything in full.\""], ["\"Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served\r\nAegisthus right, and so it would any one else who does as he did; but\r\nAegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart\r\nbleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island,\r\nfar away, poor man, from all his friends. It is an island covered\r\nwith forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there,\r\ndaughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after the bottom of the ocean,\r\nand carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth asunder. This\r\ndaughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses, and keeps trying\r\nby every kind of blandishment to make him forget his home, so that he\r\nis tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may once more see the\r\nsmoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, take no heed of this, and yet when\r\nUlysses was before Troy did he not propitiate you with many a burnt\r\nsacrifice? Why then should you keep on being so angry with him?\""], ["\"My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget\r\nUlysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor more\r\nliberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear\r\nin mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having\r\nblinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to\r\nNeptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter to the sea-king Phorcys; therefore\r\nthough he will not kill Ulysses outright, he torments him by preventing\r\nhim from getting home. Still, let us lay our heads together and see how\r\nwe can help him to return; Neptune will then be pacified, for if we are\r\nall of a mind he can hardly stand out against us.\""], ["\"Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then, the\r\ngods now mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send Mercury\r\nto the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up our minds and\r\nthat he is to return. In the meantime I will go to Ithaca, to put heart\r\ninto Ulysses' son Telemachus; I will embolden him to call the Achaeans\r\nin assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his mother Penelope, who\r\npersist in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; I will also\r\nconduct him to Sparta and to Pylos, to see if he can hear anything about\r\nthe return of his dear father--for this will make people speak well of\r\nhim.\""], ["\"I will tell you truly and particularly all about\r\nit. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians. I have\r\ncome here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign tongue\r\nbeing bound for Temesa {4} with a cargo of iron, and I shall bring back\r\ncopper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the open country away\r\nfrom the town, in the harbour Rheithron {5} under the wooded mountain\r\nNeritum. {6} Our fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will\r\ntell you, if you will go and ask him. They say, however, that he never\r\ncomes to town now, and lives by himself in the country, faring hardly,\r\nwith an old woman to look after him and get his dinner for him, when\r\nhe comes in tired from pottering about his vineyard. They told me your\r\nfather was at home again, and that was why I came, but it seems the gods\r\nare still keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on the mainland.\r\nIt is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid ocean, or a\r\nprisoner among savages who are detaining him against his will. I am no\r\nprophet, and know very little about omens, but I speak as it is borne\r\nin upon me from heaven, and assure you that he will not be away much\r\nlonger; for he is a man of such resource that even though he were in\r\nchains of iron he would find some means of getting home again. But tell\r\nme, and tell me true, can Ulysses really have such a fine looking fellow\r\nfor a son? You are indeed wonderfully like him about the head and eyes,\r\nfor we were close friends before he set sail for Troy where the flower\r\nof all the Argives went also. Since that time we have never either of us\r\nseen the other.\""], ["\"There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while\r\nPenelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me true,\r\nwhat is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people? What\r\nis it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a wedding in the\r\nfamily--for no one seems to be bringing any provisions of his own? And\r\nthe guests--how atrociously they are behaving; what riot they make over\r\nthe whole house; it is enough to disgust any respectable person who\r\ncomes near them.\""], ["\"Is that so?\""], ["\"But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return,\r\nand take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge you\r\nto set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take my advice,\r\ncall the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow morning--lay your case\r\nbefore them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitors take\r\nthemselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother's mind is set\r\non marrying again, let her go back to her father, who will find her\r\na husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so dear a\r\ndaughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you to take\r\nthe best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go in quest\r\nof your father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell\r\nyou something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some\r\nheaven-sent message may direct you. First go to Pylos and ask Nestor;\r\nthence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last of all\r\nthe Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and on his way home,\r\nyou can put up with the waste these suitors will make for yet another\r\ntwelve months. If on the other hand you hear of his death, come home at\r\nonce, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a barrow\r\nto his memory, and make your mother marry again. Then, having done all\r\nthis, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means or foul, you\r\nmay kill these suitors in your own house. You are too old to plead\r\ninfancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing Orestes'\r\npraises for having killed his father's murderer Aegisthus? You are a\r\nfine, smart looking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make yourself a\r\nname in story. Now, however, I must go back to my ship and to my crew,\r\nwho will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer; think the matter\r\nover for yourself, and remember what I have said to you.\""], ["\"Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way at\r\nonce. As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it till\r\nI come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give me a very\r\ngood one, and I will give you one of no less value in return.\""], ["\"The\r\ngods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may\r\nJove never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was before\r\nyou.\""], ["\"Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god willing,\r\nI will be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think of\r\nfor me? It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches\r\nand honour. Still, now that Ulysses is dead there are many great men in\r\nIthaca both old and young, and some other may take the lead among them;\r\nnevertheless I will be chief in my own house, and will rule those whom\r\nUlysses has won for me.\""], ["\"It rests with heaven to\r\ndecide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your\r\nown house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man\r\nin Ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow,\r\nI want to know about this stranger. What country does he come from?\r\nOf what family is he, and where is his estate? Has he brought you news\r\nabout the return of your father, or was he on business of his own? He\r\nseemed a well to do man, but he hurried off so suddenly that he was gone\r\nin a moment before we could get to know him.\""], ["\"This was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see her\r\nworking on her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick the\r\nstitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three years\r\nand we never found her out, but as time wore on and she was now in her\r\nfourth year, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told us, and\r\nwe caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to finish it\r\nwhether she would or no. The suitors, therefore, make you this answer,\r\nthat both you and the Achaeans may understand-'Send your mother away,\r\nand bid her marry the man of her own and of her father's choice'; for I\r\ndo not know what will happen if she goes on plaguing us much longer with\r\nthe airs she gives herself on the score of the accomplishments Minerva\r\nhas taught her, and because she is so clever. We never yet heard of such\r\na woman; we know all about Tyro, Alcmena, Mycene, and the famous women\r\nof old, but they were nothing to your mother any one of them. It was not\r\nfair of her to treat us in that way, and as long as she continues in\r\nthe mind with which heaven has now endowed her, so long shall we go on\r\neating up your estate; and I do not see why she should change, for she\r\ngets all the honour and glory, and it is you who pay for it, not she.\r\nUnderstand, then, that we will not go back to our lands, neither here\r\nnor elsewhere, till she has made her choice and married some one or\r\nother of us.\""], ["\"Antinous, how can I drive the mother who bore me\r\nfrom my father's house? My father is abroad and we do not know whether\r\nhe is alive or dead. It will be hard on me if I have to pay Icarius the\r\nlarge sum which I must give him if I insist on sending his daughter back\r\nto him. Not only will he deal rigorously with me, but heaven will also\r\npunish me; for my mother when she leaves the house will call on the\r\nErinyes to avenge her; besides, it would not be a creditable thing to\r\ndo, and I will have nothing to say to it. If you choose to take offence\r\nat this, leave the house and feast elsewhere at one another's houses at\r\nyour own cost turn and turn about. If, on the other hand, you elect to\r\npersist in spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon\r\nwith you in full, and when you fall in my father's house there shall be\r\nno man to avenge you.\""], ["\"Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly to the suitors,\r\nfor I see mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not going to be\r\naway much longer; indeed he is close at hand to deal out death and\r\ndestruction, not on them alone, but on many another of us who live in\r\nIthaca. Let us then be wise in time, and put a stop to this wickedness\r\nbefore he comes. Let the suitors do so of their own accord; it will\r\nbe better for them, for I am not prophesying without due knowledge;\r\neverything has happened to Ulysses as I foretold when the Argives set\r\nout for Troy, and he with them. I said that after going through much\r\nhardship and losing all his men he should come home again in the\r\ntwentieth year and that no one would know him; and now all this is\r\ncoming true.\""], ["\"Go home, old man, and prophesy to\r\nyour own children, or it may be worse for them. I can read these omens\r\nmyself much better than you can; birds are always flying about in the\r\nsunshine somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything. Ulysses has\r\ndied in a far country, and it is a pity you are not dead along with\r\nhim, instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel to the anger of\r\nTelemachus which is fierce enough as it is. I suppose you think he will\r\ngive you something for your family, but I tell you--and it shall surely\r\nbe--when an old man like you, who should know better, talks a young one\r\nover till he becomes troublesome, in the first place his young friend\r\nwill only fare so much the worse--he will take nothing by it, for the\r\nsuitors will prevent this--and in the next, we will lay a heavier fine,\r\nsir, upon yourself than you will at all like paying, for it will bear\r\nhardly upon you. As for Telemachus, I warn him in the presence of you\r\nall to send his mother back to her father, who will find her a husband\r\nand provide her with all the marriage gifts so dear a daughter may\r\nexpect. Till then we shall go on harassing him with our suit; for we\r\nfear no man, and care neither for him, with all his fine speeches, nor\r\nfor any fortune-telling of yours. You may preach as much as you please,\r\nbut we shall only hate you the more. We shall go back and continue to\r\neat up Telemachus's estate without paying him, till such time as his\r\nmother leaves off tormenting us by keeping us day after day on the\r\ntiptoe of expectation, each vying with the other in his suit for a prize\r\nof such rare perfection. Besides we cannot go after the other women whom\r\nwe should marry in due course, but for the way in which she treats us.\""], ["\"Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall say no\r\nmore, and entreat you no further, for the gods and the people of Ithaca\r\nnow know my story. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty men to\r\ntake me hither and thither, and I will go to Sparta and to Pylos in\r\nquest of my father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell\r\nme something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some\r\nheaven-sent message may direct me. If I can hear of him as alive and on\r\nhis way home I will put up with the waste you suitors will make for yet\r\nanother twelve months. If on the other hand I hear of his death, I will\r\nreturn at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a\r\nbarrow to his memory, and make my mother marry again.\""], ["\"Hear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind and\r\nwell-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern you equitably;\r\nI hope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for\r\nthere is not one of you but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled you as\r\nthough he were your father. I am not half so angry with the suitors, for\r\nif they choose to do violence in the naughtiness of their hearts, and\r\nwager their heads that Ulysses will not return, they can take the high\r\nhand and eat up his estate, but as for you others I am shocked at\r\nthe way in which you all sit still without even trying to stop such\r\nscandalous goings on--which you could do if you chose, for you are many\r\nand they are few.\""], ["\"Mentor, what folly is\r\nall this, that you should set the people to stay us? It is a hard thing\r\nfor one man to fight with many about his victuals. Even though Ulysses\r\nhimself were to set upon us while we are feasting in his house, and do\r\nhis best to oust us, his wife, who wants him back so very badly, would\r\nhave small cause for rejoicing, and his blood would be upon his own head\r\nif he fought against such great odds. There is no sense in what you have\r\nbeen saying. Now, therefore, do you people go about your business, and\r\nlet his father's old friends, Mentor and Halitherses, speed this boy on\r\nhis journey, if he goes at all--which I do not think he will, for he\r\nis more likely to stay where he is till some one comes and tells him\r\nsomething.\""], ["\"Telemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear no more ill blood neither\r\nin word nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used to do. The\r\nAchaeans will find you in everything--a ship and a picked crew to\r\nboot--so that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news of your\r\nnoble father.\""], ["\"Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will be like\r\nhis father and perish far from his friends. In this case we should have\r\nplenty to do, for we could then divide up his property amongst us: as\r\nfor the house we can let his mother and the man who marries her have\r\nthat.\""], ["\"Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you\r\nare keeping for my father's own drinking, in case, poor man, he should\r\nescape death, and find his way home again after all. Let me have twelve\r\njars, and see that they all have lids; also fill me some well-sewn\r\nleathern bags with barley meal--about twenty measures in all. Get these\r\nthings put together at once, and say nothing about it. I will take\r\neverything away this evening as soon as my mother has gone upstairs\r\nfor the night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylos to see if I can hear\r\nanything about the return of my dear father.\""], ["\"My dear child, what ever can have put such notion as that into\r\nyour head? Where in the world do you want to go to--you, who are the\r\none hope of the house? Your poor father is dead and gone in some foreign\r\ncountry nobody knows where, and as soon as your back is turned these\r\nwicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out of the way, and\r\nwill share all your possessions among themselves; stay where you are\r\namong your own people, and do not go wandering and worrying your life\r\nout on the barren ocean.\""], ["\"Now my men, help me to get the stores on board;\r\nthey are all put together in the cloister, and my mother does not know\r\nanything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one.\""], ["\"Telemachus, you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you have taken\r\nthis voyage to try and find out where your father is buried and how he\r\ncame by his end; so go straight up to Nestor that we may see what he has\r\ngot to tell us. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will tell no lies,\r\nfor he is an excellent person.\""], ["\"My friend,\""], ["\"Therefore, my dear young friend, I returned without hearing anything\r\nabout the others. I know neither who got home safely nor who were lost\r\nbut, as in duty bound, I will give you without reserve the reports that\r\nhave reached me since I have been here in my own house. They say the\r\nMyrmidons returned home safely under Achilles' son Neoptolemus; so also\r\ndid the valiant son of Poias, Philoctetes. Idomeneus, again, lost no men\r\nat sea, and all his followers who escaped death in the field got safe\r\nhome with him to Crete. No matter how far out of the world you live, you\r\nwill have heard of Agamemnon and the bad end he came to at the hands of\r\nAegisthus--and a fearful reckoning did Aegisthus presently pay. See what\r\na good thing it is for a man to leave a son behind him to do as Orestes\r\ndid, who killed false Aegisthus the murderer of his noble father. You\r\ntoo, then--for you are a tall smart-looking fellow--show your mettle and\r\nmake yourself a name in story.\""], ["\"I can expect nothing of the kind; it would be far\r\ntoo much to hope for. I dare not let myself think of it. Even though the\r\ngods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befall me.\""], ["\"Telemachus, what are you talking about? Heaven\r\nhas a long arm if it is minded to save a man; and if it were me, I\r\nshould not care how much I suffered before getting home, provided I\r\ncould be safe when I was once there. I would rather this, than get home\r\nquickly, and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnon was by the\r\ntreachery of Aegisthus and his wife. Still, death is certain, and when\r\na man's hour is come, not even the gods can save him, no matter how fond\r\nthey are of him.\""], ["\"I will tell you truly,\""], ["\"Take my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so far\r\nfrom home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your\r\nhouse; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you will\r\nhave been on a fool's errand. Still, I should advise you by all means\r\nto go and visit Menelaus, who has lately come off a voyage among such\r\ndistant peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from, when the\r\nwinds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning; even birds\r\ncannot fly the distance in a twelve-month, so vast and terrible are the\r\nseas that they must cross. Go to him, therefore, by sea, and take your\r\nown men with you; or if you would rather travel by land you can have a\r\nchariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons who can escort you to\r\nLacedaemon where Menelaus lives. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he\r\nwill tell you no lies, for he is an excellent person.\""], ["\"Sir,\r\nall that you have said is well; now, however, order the tongues of the\r\nvictims to be cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings to\r\nNeptune, and the other immortals, and then go to bed, for it is bed\r\ntime. People should go away early and not keep late hours at a religious\r\nfestival.\""], ["\"Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be much\r\nbetter that Telemachus should do as you have said; he, therefore, shall\r\nreturn with you and sleep at your house, but I must go back to give\r\norders to my crew, and keep them in good heart. I am the only older\r\nperson among them; the rest are all young men of Telemachus' own age,\r\nwho have taken this voyage out of friendship; so I must return to the\r\nship and sleep there. Moreover to-morrow I must go to the Cauconians\r\nwhere I have a large sum of money long owing to me. As for Telemachus,\r\nnow that he is your guest, send him to Lacedaemon in a chariot, and let\r\none of your sons go with him. Be pleased to also provide him with your\r\nbest and fleetest horses.\""], ["\"Sons, put Telemachus's horses to\r\nthe chariot that he may start at once.\""], ["\"Menelaus, there are some strangers come here, two\r\nmen, who look like sons of Jove. What are we to do? Shall we take their\r\nhorses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best can?\""], ["\"Eteoneus, son of Boethous, you never\r\nused to be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their horses\r\nout, of course, and show the strangers in that they may have supper;\r\nyou and I have staid often enough at other people's houses before we got\r\nback here, where heaven grant that we may rest in peace henceforward.\""], ["\"Fall to, and welcome; when you have\r\ndone supper I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of such men as\r\nyou cannot have been lost. You must be descended from a line of\r\nsceptre-bearing kings, for poor people do not have such sons as you\r\nare.\""], ["\"Look, Pisistratus, man after my own heart,\r\nsee the gleam of bronze and gold--of amber, {40} ivory, and silver.\r\nEverything is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace of Olympian\r\nJove. I am lost in admiration.\""], ["\"No one, my sons, can hold his own\r\nwith Jove, for his house and everything about him is immortal; but among\r\nmortal men--well, there may be another who has as much wealth as I\r\nhave, or there may not; but at all events I have travelled much and have\r\nundergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years before I could\r\nget home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus, Phoenicia and the Egyptians;\r\nI went also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the Erembians, and to\r\nLibya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are born, and the sheep\r\nlamb down three times a year. Every one in that country, whether master\r\nor man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good milk, for the ewes yield\r\nall the year round. But while I was travelling and getting great riches\r\namong these people, my brother was secretly and shockingly murdered\r\nthrough the perfidy of his wicked wife, so that I have no pleasure in\r\nbeing lord of all this wealth. Whoever your parents may be they must\r\nhave told you about all this, and of my heavy loss in the ruin {41} of a\r\nstately mansion fully and magnificently furnished. Would that I had only\r\na third of what I now have so that I had stayed at home, and all those\r\nwere living who perished on the plain of Troy, far from Argos. I often\r\ngrieve, as I sit here in my house, for one and all of them. At times\r\nI cry aloud for sorrow, but presently I leave off again, for crying is\r\ncold comfort and one soon tires of it. Yet grieve for these as I may,\r\nI do so for one man more than for them all. I cannot even think of him\r\nwithout loathing both food and sleep, so miserable does he make me, for\r\nno one of all the Achaeans worked so hard or risked so much as he did.\r\nHe took nothing by it, and has left a legacy of sorrow to myself, for he\r\nhas been gone a long time, and we know not whether he is alive or\r\ndead. His old father, his long-suffering wife Penelope, and his son\r\nTelemachus, whom he left behind him an infant in arms, are plunged in\r\ngrief on his account.\""], ["\"Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in\r\nthinking that this young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest, and\r\nis ashamed to come here and begin opening up discourse with one whose\r\nconversation is so divinely interesting as your own. My father, Nestor,\r\nsent me to escort him hither, for he wanted to know whether you could\r\ngive him any counsel or suggestion. A son has always trouble at home\r\nwhen his father has gone away leaving him without supporters; and this\r\nis how Telemachus is now placed, for his father is absent, and there is\r\nno one among his own people to stand by him.\""], ["\"Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, told me\r\nyou were a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then, it be\r\npossible, do as I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while I am\r\ngetting my supper. Morning will come in due course, and in the forenoon\r\nI care not how much I cry for those that are dead and gone. This is all\r\nwe can do for the poor things. We can only shave our heads for them and\r\nwring the tears from our cheeks. I had a brother who died at Troy; he\r\nwas by no means the worst man there; you are sure to have known him--his\r\nname was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon him myself, but they say that\r\nhe was singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant.\""], ["\"Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honourable\r\nmen (which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of good and evil,\r\nand can do what he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen while I\r\ntell you a tale in season. I cannot indeed name every single one of the\r\nexploits of Ulysses, but I can say what he did when he was before Troy,\r\nand you Achaeans were in all sorts of difficulties. He covered himself\r\nwith wounds and bruises, dressed himself all in rags, and entered the\r\nenemy's city looking like a menial or a beggar, and quite different\r\nfrom what he did when he was among his own people. In this disguise\r\nhe entered the city of Troy, and no one said anything to him. I alone\r\nrecognised him and began to question him, but he was too cunning for me.\r\nWhen, however, I had washed and anointed him and had given him clothes,\r\nand after I had sworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the Trojans\r\ntill he had got safely back to his own camp and to the ships, he told me\r\nall that the Achaeans meant to do. He killed many Trojans and got much\r\ninformation before he reached the Argive camp, for all which things the\r\nTrojan women made lamentation, but for my own part I was glad, for my\r\nheart was beginning to yearn after my home, and I was unhappy about\r\nthe wrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there, away from\r\nmy country, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, who is indeed by no\r\nmeans deficient either in person or understanding.\""], ["\"All that you have been saying, my dear wife, is\r\ntrue. I have travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes, but\r\nI have never seen such another man as Ulysses. What endurance too,\r\nand what courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein all the\r\nbravest of the Argives were lying in wait to bring death and destruction\r\nupon the Trojans. {43} At that moment you came up to us; some god\r\nwho wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to it and you had\r\nDeiphobus with you. Three times did you go all round our hiding place\r\nand pat it; you called our chiefs each by his own name, and mimicked\r\nall our wives--Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seats inside heard what\r\na noise you made. Diomed and I could not make up our minds whether to\r\nspring out then and there, or to answer you from inside, but Ulysses\r\nheld us all in check, so we sat quite still, all except Anticlus, who\r\nwas beginning to answer you, when Ulysses clapped his two brawny hands\r\nover his mouth, and kept them there. It was this that saved us all, for\r\nhe muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away again.\""], ["\"And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage to\r\nLacedaemon? Are you on public, or private business? Tell me all about\r\nit.\""], ["\"So,\""], ["\"And now for yourself--stay here some ten or twelve days longer, and I\r\nwill then speed you on your way. I will make you a noble present of a\r\nchariot and three horses. I will also give you a beautiful chalice\r\nthat so long as you live you may think of me whenever you make a\r\ndrink-offering to the immortal gods.\""], ["\"Have we any idea, Antinous, on what day Telemachus returns from Pylos?\r\nHe has a ship of mine, and I want it, to cross over to Elis: I have\r\ntwelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their side not yet\r\nbroken in, and I want to bring one of them over here and break him.\""], ["\"When did he go? Tell me truly, and\r\nwhat young men did he take with him? Were they freemen or his own\r\nbondsmen--for he might manage that too? Tell me also, did you let him\r\nhave the ship of your own free will because he asked you, or did he take\r\nit without your leave?\""], ["\"Good heavens, this voyage of Telemachus is a very serious matter; we\r\nhad made sure that it would come to nothing, but the young fellow has\r\ngot away in spite of us, and with a picked crew too. He will be giving\r\nus trouble presently; may Jove take him before he is full grown. Find me\r\na ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and I will lie in wait for\r\nhim in the straits between Ithaca and Samos; he will then rue the day\r\nthat he set out to try and get news of his father.\""], ["\"Medon, what have the suitors sent you here for? Is it to tell the maids\r\nto leave their master's business and cook dinner for them? I wish they\r\nmay neither woo nor dine henceforward, neither here nor anywhere else,\r\nbut let this be the very last time, for the waste you all make of my\r\nson's estate. Did not your fathers tell you when you were children, how\r\ngood Ulysses had been to them--never doing anything high-handed, nor\r\nspeaking harshly to anybody? Kings may say things sometimes, and they\r\nmay take a fancy to one man and dislike another, but Ulysses never did\r\nan unjust thing by anybody--which shows what bad hearts you have, and\r\nthat there is no such thing as gratitude left in this world.\""], ["\"I wish, Madam, that this were all; but they are\r\nplotting something much more dreadful now--may heaven frustrate their\r\ndesign. They are going to try and murder Telemachus as he is coming home\r\nfrom Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been to get news of his father.\""], ["\"Why did my son leave me? What business had\r\nhe to go sailing off in ships that make long voyages over the ocean like\r\nsea-horses? Does he want to die without leaving any one behind him to\r\nkeep up his name?\""], ["\"My dears, heaven has been pleased to try me with more affliction\r\nthan any other woman of my age and country. First I lost my brave and\r\nlion-hearted husband, who had every good quality under heaven, and whose\r\nname was great over all Hellas and middle Argos, and now my darling son\r\nis at the mercy of the winds and waves, without my having heard one word\r\nabout his leaving home. You hussies, there was not one of you would so\r\nmuch as think of giving me a call out of my bed, though you all of you\r\nvery well knew when he was starting. If I had known he meant taking this\r\nvoyage, he would have had to give it up, no matter how much he was bent\r\nupon it, or leave me a corpse behind him--one or other. Now, however,\r\ngo some of you and call old Dolius, who was given me by my father on my\r\nmarriage, and who is my gardener. Bid him go at once and tell everything\r\nto Laertes, who may be able to hit on some plan for enlisting public\r\nsympathy on our side, as against those who are trying to exterminate his\r\nown race and that of Ulysses.\""], ["\"You may kill me, Madam, or let\r\nme live on in your house, whichever you please, but I will tell you the\r\nreal truth. I knew all about it, and gave him everything he wanted in\r\nthe way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemn oath that I\r\nwould not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days, unless you\r\nasked or happened to hear of his having gone, for he did not want you to\r\nspoil your beauty by crying. And now, Madam, wash your face, change\r\nyour dress, and go upstairs with your maids to offer prayers to Minerva,\r\ndaughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, for she can save him even though he\r\nbe in the jaws of death. Do not trouble Laertes: he has trouble enough\r\nalready. Besides, I cannot think that the gods hate the race of the son\r\nof Arceisius so much, but there will be a son left to come up after him,\r\nand inherit both the house and the fair fields that lie far all round\r\nit.\""], ["\"The queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us. Little\r\ndoes she dream that her son has now been doomed to die.\""], ["\"Comrades, let there be no loud talking, lest some\r\nof it get carried inside. Let us be up and do that in silence, about\r\nwhich we are all of a mind.\""], ["\"You are asleep, Penelope: the gods who live at ease will not suffer you\r\nto weep and be so sad. Your son has done them no wrong, so he will yet\r\ncome back to you.\""], ["\"Sister, why have you come here? You do not come very often, but I\r\nsuppose that is because you live such a long way off. Am I, then, to\r\nleave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture me?\r\nI, who have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, who had every good\r\nquality under heaven, and whose name was great over all Hellas and\r\nmiddle Argos; and now my darling son has gone off on board of a ship--a\r\nfoolish fellow who has never been used to roughing it, nor to going\r\nabout among gatherings of men. I am even more anxious about him than\r\nabout my husband; I am all in a tremble when I think of him, lest\r\nsomething should happen to him, either from the people among whom he has\r\ngone, or by sea, for he has many enemies who are plotting against him,\r\nand are bent on killing him before he can return home.\""], ["\"Take heart, and be not so much dismayed. There is\r\none gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough to have stand by\r\nhis side, I mean Minerva; it is she who has compassion upon you, and who\r\nhas sent me to bear you this message.\""], ["\"I shall not tell you for certain whether he is\r\nalive or dead, and there is no use in idle conversation.\""], ["\"Mercury, you are\r\nour messenger, go therefore and tell Calypso we have decreed that poor\r\nUlysses is to return home. He is to be convoyed neither by gods nor men,\r\nbut after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is to reach\r\nfertile Scheria, {50} the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to\r\nthe gods, and will honour him as though he were one of ourselves. They\r\nwill send him in a ship to his own country, and will give him more\r\nbronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought back from Troy,\r\nif he had had all his prize money and had got home without disaster.\r\nThis is how we have settled that he shall return to his country and his\r\nfriends.\""], ["\"Why have you come to see me,\r\nMercury--honoured, and ever welcome--for you do not visit me often? Say\r\nwhat you want; I will do it for you at once if I can, and if it can be\r\ndone at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before you.\""], ["\"We are speaking god and goddess to one another, and you ask me why I\r\nhave come here, and I will tell you truly as you would have me do. Jove\r\nsent me; it was no doing of mine; who could possibly want to come all\r\nthis way over the sea where there are no cities full of people to offer\r\nme sacrifices or choice hecatombs? Nevertheless I had to come, for none\r\nof us other gods can cross Jove, nor transgress his orders. He says that\r\nyou have here the most ill-starred of all those who fought nine years\r\nbefore the city of King Priam and sailed home in the tenth year after\r\nhaving sacked it. On their way home they sinned against Minerva, {52}\r\nwho raised both wind and waves against them, so that all his brave\r\ncompanions perished, and he alone was carried hither by wind and tide.\r\nJove says that you are to let this man go at once, for it is decreed\r\nthat he shall not perish here, far from his own people, but shall return\r\nto his house and country and see his friends again.\""], ["\"My poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your life\r\nout any longer. I am going to send you away of my own free will; so go,\r\ncut some beams of wood, and make yourself a large raft with an upper\r\ndeck that it may carry you safely over the sea. I will put bread, wine,\r\nand water on board to save you from starving. I will also give you\r\nclothes, and will send you a fair wind to take you home, if the gods in\r\nheaven so will it--for they know more about these things, and can settle\r\nthem better than I can.\""], ["\"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, so you would start home to your own\r\nland at once? Good luck go with you, but if you could only know how much\r\nsuffering is in store for you before you get back to your own country,\r\nyou would stay where you are, keep house along with me, and let me\r\nmake you immortal, no matter how anxious you may be to see this wife\r\nof yours, of whom you are thinking all the time day after day; yet I\r\nflatter myself that I am no whit less tall or well-looking than she\r\nis, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman should compare in\r\nbeauty with an immortal.\""], ["\"Good heavens, so the gods have\r\nbeen changing their minds about Ulysses while I was away in Ethiopia,\r\nand now he is close to the land of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed\r\nthat he shall escape from the calamities that have befallen him. Still,\r\nhe shall have plenty of hardship yet before he has done with it.\""], ["\"There now, swim\r\nup and down as you best can till you fall in with well-to-do people.\r\nI do not think you will be able to say that I have let you off too\r\nlightly.\""], ["\"Alas, Jove has let me see land after swimming so far that I\r\nhad given up all hope, but I can find no landing place, for the coast is\r\nrocky and surf-beaten, the rocks are smooth and rise sheer from the sea,\r\nwith deep water close under them so that I cannot climb out for want of\r\nfoot hold. I am afraid some great wave will lift me off my legs and dash\r\nme against the rocks as I leave the water--which would give me a\r\nsorry landing. If, on the other hand, I swim further in search of some\r\nshelving beach or harbour, a hurricane may carry me out to sea again\r\nsorely against my will, or heaven may send some great monster of the\r\ndeep to attack me; for Amphitrite breeds many such, and I know that\r\nNeptune is very angry with me.\""], ["\"Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger of the\r\nsea-god Neptune, for I approach you prayerfully. Any one who has lost\r\nhis way has at all times a claim even upon the gods, wherefore in my\r\ndistress I draw near to your stream, and cling to the knees of your\r\nriverhood. Have mercy upon me, O king, for I declare myself your\r\nsuppliant.\""], ["\"Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, to have such a lazy\r\ndaughter? Here are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are going\r\nto be married almost immediately, and should not only be well dressed\r\nyourself, but should find good clothes for those who attend you. This is\r\nthe way to get yourself a good name, and to make your father and mother\r\nproud of you. Suppose, then, that we make tomorrow a washing day,\r\nand start at daybreak. I will come and help you so that you may have\r\neverything ready as soon as possible, for all the best young men among\r\nyour own people are courting you, and you are not going to remain a\r\nmaid much longer. Ask your father, therefore, to have a waggon and mules\r\nready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs, robes, and girdles, and you\r\ncan ride, too, which will be much pleasanter for you than walking, for\r\nthe washing-cisterns are some way from the town.\""], ["\"Papa dear, could you manage to let me have a good big waggon? I want to\r\ntake all our dirty clothes to the river and wash them. You are the chief\r\nman here, so it is only right that you should have a clean shirt when\r\nyou attend meetings of the council. Moreover, you have five sons at\r\nhome, two of them married, while the other three are good looking\r\nbachelors; you know they always like to have clean linen when they go to\r\na dance, and I have been thinking about all this.\""], ["\"You shall have the mules, my love, and\r\nwhatever else you have a mind for. Be off with you, and the men shall\r\nget you a good strong waggon with a body to it that will hold all your\r\nclothes.\""], ["\"O queen,\""], ["\"And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person I\r\nhave met, and I know no one else in this country. Show me the way to\r\nyour town, and let me have anything that you may have brought hither to\r\nwrap your clothes in. May heaven grant you in all things your heart's\r\ndesire--husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home; for there is nothing\r\nbetter in this world than that man and wife should be of one mind in a\r\nhouse. It discomfits their enemies, makes the hearts of their friends\r\nglad, and they themselves know more about it than any one.\""], ["\"Stranger, you appear to be a sensible,\r\nwell-disposed person. There is no accounting for luck; Jove gives\r\nprosperity to rich and poor just as he chooses, so you must take what\r\nhe has seen fit to send you, and make the best of it. Now, however, that\r\nyou have come to this our country, you shall not want for clothes nor\r\nfor anything else that a foreigner in distress may reasonably look for.\r\nI will show you the way to the town, and will tell you the name of our\r\npeople; we are called Phaeacians, and I am daughter to Alcinous, in whom\r\nthe whole power of the state is vested.\""], ["\"Stay where you are, you girls. Can\r\nyou not see a man without running away from him? Do you take him for a\r\nrobber or a murderer? Neither he nor any one else can come here to do\r\nus Phaeacians any harm, for we are dear to the gods, and live apart on a\r\nland's end that juts into the sounding sea, and have nothing to do with\r\nany other people. This is only some poor man who has lost his way, and\r\nwe must be kind to him, for strangers and foreigners in distress\r\nare under Jove's protection, and will take what they can get and be\r\nthankful; so, girls, give the poor fellow something to eat and drink,\r\nand wash him in the stream at some place that is sheltered from the\r\nwind.\""], ["\"Young women, please to stand a little on one side\r\nthat I may wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myself with oil,\r\nfor it is long enough since my skin has had a drop of oil upon it. I\r\ncannot wash as long as you all keep standing there. I am ashamed to\r\nstrip {56} before a number of good looking young women.\""], ["\"Hush, my dears, for I want to say something. I believe the gods who\r\nlive in heaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I first saw\r\nhim I thought him plain, but now his appearance is like that of the gods\r\nwho dwell in heaven. I should like my future husband to be just such\r\nanother as he is, if he would only stay here and not want to go away.\r\nHowever, give him something to eat and drink.\""], ["\"Stranger,\""], ["\"If, therefore, you want my father to give you an escort and to help you\r\nhome, do as I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars by the\r\nroad side dedicated to Minerva; it has a well in it and a meadow all\r\nround it. Here my father has a field of rich garden ground, about as far\r\nfrom the town as a man's voice will carry. Sit down there and wait for\r\na while till the rest of us can get into the town and reach my father's\r\nhouse. Then, when you think we must have done this, come into the town\r\nand ask the way to the house of my father Alcinous. You will have no\r\ndifficulty in finding it; any child will point it out to you, for no one\r\nelse in the whole town has anything like such a fine house as he has.\r\nWhen you have got past the gates and through the outer court, go right\r\nacross the inner court till you come to my mother. You will find her\r\nsitting by the fire and spinning her purple wool by firelight. It is a\r\nfine sight to see her as she leans back against one of the bearing-posts\r\nwith her maids all ranged behind her. Close to her seat stands that of\r\nmy father, on which he sits and topes like an immortal god. Never mind\r\nhim, but go up to my mother, and lay your hands upon her knees if you\r\nwould get home quickly. If you can gain her over, you may hope to see\r\nyour own country again, no matter how distant it may be.\""], ["\"My dear, will you be so kind as to show me the house of king Alcinous?\r\nI am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and do not know one in your\r\ntown and country.\""], ["\"Yes, father stranger, I will show you the house you\r\nwant, for Alcinous lives quite close to my own father. I will go before\r\nyou and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and do not look\r\nat any man, nor ask him questions; for the people here cannot abide\r\nstrangers, and do not like men who come from some other place. They are\r\na sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace of Neptune in ships\r\nthat glide along like thought, or as a bird in the air.\""], ["\"Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her\r\nchildren, by Alcinous himself, and by the whole people, who look upon\r\nher as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city, for\r\nshe is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart, and when any\r\nwomen are friends of hers, she will help their husbands also to settle\r\ntheir disputes. If you can gain her good will, you may have every hope\r\nof seeing your friends again, and getting safely back to your home and\r\ncountry.\""], ["\"Pontonous, mix a cup of wine and hand it round that\r\nwe may make drink-offerings to Jove the lord of thunder, who is the\r\nprotector of all well-disposed suppliants.\""], ["\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You\r\nhave had your supper, so now go home to bed. To-morrow morning I shall\r\ninvite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial\r\nbanquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss the question of his\r\nescort, and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing to his\r\nown country without trouble or inconvenience to himself, no matter how\r\ndistant it may be. We must see that he comes to no harm while on his\r\nhomeward journey, but when he is once at home he will have to take\r\nthe luck he was born with for better or worse like other people. It is\r\npossible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals who\r\nhas come down from heaven to visit us; but in this case the gods\r\nare departing from their usual practice, for hitherto they have made\r\nthemselves perfectly clear to us when we have been offering them\r\nhecatombs. They come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves,\r\nand if any solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon some one or other\r\nof them, they affect no concealment, for we are as near of kin to the\r\ngods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are.\""], ["\"Pray, Alcinous, do not take any such notion into\r\nyour head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body\r\nnor mind, and most resemble those among you who are the most afflicted.\r\nIndeed, were I to tell you all that heaven has seen fit to lay upon me,\r\nyou would say that I was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless,\r\nlet me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very\r\nimportunate thing, and thrusts itself on a man's notice no matter how\r\ndire is his distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insists that I shall\r\neat and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and dwell only\r\non the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves, do as you propose,\r\nand at break of day set about helping me to get home. I shall be content\r\nto die if I may first once more behold my property, my bondsmen, and all\r\nthe greatness of my house.\""], ["\"Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should like\r\nto ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes? Did\r\nyou not say you had come here from beyond the sea?\""], ["\"There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and the\r\nwaves dashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea and swam\r\non till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing place, for\r\nthere were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then, I\r\ngot out of the water and gathered my senses together again. Night was\r\ncoming on, so I left the river, and went into a thicket, where I covered\r\nmyself all over with leaves, and presently heaven sent me off into a\r\nvery deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept among the leaves all\r\nnight, and through the next day till afternoon, when I woke as the sun\r\nwas westering, and saw your daughter's maid servants playing upon the\r\nbeach, and your daughter among them looking like a goddess. I besought\r\nher aid, and she proved to be of an excellent disposition, much more so\r\nthan could be expected from so young a person--for young people are apt\r\nto be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine, and when she\r\nhad had me washed in the river she also gave me the clothes in which you\r\nsee me. Now, therefore, though it has pained me to do so, I have told\r\nyou the whole truth.\""], ["\"Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not to\r\nbring you on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing that she\r\nwas the first person whose aid you asked.\""], ["\"Father Jove, grant that\r\nAlcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an imperishable\r\nname among mankind, and at the same time I shall return to my country.\""], ["\"Rise, sir\r\nstranger, and come with us for your bed is ready,\""], ["\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, come to the assembly\r\nall of you and listen to the stranger who has just come off a long\r\nvoyage to the house of King Alcinous; he looks like an immortal god.\""], ["\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, we\r\nhave had enough now, both of the feast, and of the minstrelsy that is\r\nits due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore to the athletic sports,\r\nso that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friends\r\nhow much we surpass all other nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and\r\nrunners.\""], ["\"Let us ask the stranger whether he excels\r\nin any of these sports; he seems very powerfully built; his thighs,\r\ncalves, hands, and neck are of prodigious strength, nor is he at all\r\nold, but he has suffered much lately, and there is nothing like the sea\r\nfor making havoc with a man, no matter how strong he is.\""], ["\"I hope, Sir, that you will enter yourself for some\r\none or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of them--and\r\nyou must have gone in for many a one before now. There is nothing that\r\ndoes any one so much credit all his life long as the showing himself a\r\nproper man with his hands and feet. Have a try therefore at something,\r\nand banish all sorrow from your mind. Your return home will not be long\r\ndelayed, for the ship is already drawn into the water, and the crew is\r\nfound.\""], ["\"Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? my mind is\r\nset rather on cares than contests; I have been through infinite trouble,\r\nand am come among you now as a suppliant, praying your king and people\r\nto further me on my return home.\""], ["\"I gather, then, that you\r\nare unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight in. I\r\nsuppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about in ships\r\nas captains or merchants, and who think of nothing but of their outward\r\nfreights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem to be much of the\r\nathlete about you.\""], ["\"Sir, we have\r\nhad much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from which I\r\nunderstand that you are willing to show your prowess, as having been\r\ndispleased with some insolent remarks that have been made to you by one\r\nof our athletes, and which could never have been uttered by any one who\r\nknows how to talk with propriety. I hope you will apprehend my meaning,\r\nand will explain to any one of your chief men who may be dining with\r\nyourself and your family when you get home, that we have an hereditary\r\naptitude for accomplishments of all kinds. We are not particularly\r\nremarkable for our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers, but we are singularly\r\nfleet of foot and are excellent sailors. We are extremely fond of good\r\ndinners, music, and dancing; we also like frequent changes of linen,\r\nwarm baths, and good beds, so now, please, some of you who are the best\r\ndancers set about dancing, that our guest on his return home may be able\r\nto tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as sailors,\r\nrunners, dancers, and minstrels. Demodocus has left his lyre at my\r\nhouse, so run some one or other of you and fetch it for him.\""], ["\"Let us go to the couch of Vulcan: he is not at\r\nhome, but is gone off to Lemnos among the Sintians, whose speech is\r\nbarbarous.\""], ["\"Ill deeds do not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See how\r\nlimping Vulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars who is the fleetest god\r\nin heaven; and now Mars will be cast in heavy damages.\""], ["\"Messenger\r\nMercury, giver of good things, you would not care how strong the chains\r\nwere, would you, if you could sleep with Venus?\""], ["\"King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in the\r\nworld, and indeed they have proved themselves to be so. I was astonished\r\nas I saw them.\""], ["\"Aldermen and town councillors, our guest seems to be a person of\r\nsingular judgement; let us give him such proof of our hospitality as\r\nhe may reasonably expect. There are twelve chief men among you, and\r\ncounting myself there are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a clean\r\ncloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this in\r\na lump down at once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so with a\r\nlight heart. As for Euryalus he will have to make a formal apology and a\r\npresent too, for he has been rude.\""], ["\"King\r\nAlcinous, I will give the stranger all the satisfaction you require. He\r\nshall have my sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt, which is of\r\nsilver. I will also give him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into which\r\nit fits. It will be worth a great deal to him.\""], ["\"Good\r\nluck to you, father stranger; if anything has been said amiss may the\r\nwinds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you a safe return,\r\nfor I understand you have been long away from home, and have gone\r\nthrough much hardship.\""], ["\"Good luck to you too my friend, and may the\r\ngods grant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss the sword you\r\nhave given me along with your apology.\""], ["\"See to the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once, for\r\nfear any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in your\r\nship.\""], ["\"Nausicaa, daughter of great Alcinous, may Jove the\r\nmighty husband of Juno, grant that I may reach my home; so shall I bless\r\nyou as my guardian angel all my days, for it was you who saved me.\""], ["\"Take this piece of pork over to Demodocus and tell him to eat it; for\r\nall the pain his lays may cause me I will salute him none the less;\r\nbards are honoured and respected throughout the world, for the muse\r\nteaches them their songs and loves them.\""], ["\"Demodocus, there is no one in the\r\nworld whom I admire more than I do you. You must have studied under the\r\nMuse, Jove's daughter, and under Apollo, so accurately do you sing the\r\nreturn of the Achaeans with all their sufferings and adventures. If you\r\nwere not there yourself, you must have heard it all from some one who\r\nwas. Now, however, change your song and tell us of the wooden horse\r\nwhich Epeus made with the assistance of Minerva, and which Ulysses got\r\nby stratagem into the fort of Troy after freighting it with the men who\r\nafterwards sacked the city. If you will sing this tale aright I will\r\ntell all the world how magnificently heaven has endowed you.\""], ["\"And now, tell me and tell me true. Where have you been wandering, and\r\nin what countries have you travelled? Tell us of the peoples themselves,\r\nand of their cities--who were hostile, savage and uncivilised, and who,\r\non the other hand, hospitable and humane. Tell us also why you are made\r\nso unhappy on hearing about the return of the Argive Danaans from Troy.\r\nThe gods arranged all this, and sent them their misfortunes in order\r\nthat future generations might have something to sing about. Did you\r\nlose some brave kinsman of your wife's when you were before Troy? a\r\nson-in-law or father-in-law--which are the nearest relations a man has\r\noutside his own flesh and blood? or was it some brave and kindly-natured\r\ncomrade--for a good friend is as dear to a man as his own brother?\""], ["\"I also saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle, who sold her own\r\nhusband for gold. But it would take me all night if I were to name every\r\nsingle one of the wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw, and it is\r\ntime for me to go to bed, either on board ship with my crew, or here. As\r\nfor my escort, heaven and yourselves will see to it.\""], ["\"What do you think of this man, O Phaeacians? Is he not tall and good\r\nlooking, and is he not clever? True, he is my own guest, but all of you\r\nshare in the distinction. Do not be in a hurry to send him away, nor\r\nniggardly in the presents you make to one who is in such great need, for\r\nheaven has blessed all of you with great abundance.\""], ["\"King Alcinous, if you were to bid me to stay here\r\nfor a whole twelve months, and then speed me on my way, loaded with your\r\nnoble gifts, I should obey you gladly and it would redound greatly to\r\nmy advantage, for I should return fuller-handed to my own people, and\r\nshould thus be more respected and beloved by all who see me when I get\r\nback to Ithaca.\""], ["\"Alcinous,\""], ["\"Hence I was carried along for nine days till on the tenth night the\r\ngods stranded me on the Ogygian island, where dwells the great and\r\npowerful goddess Calypso. She took me in and was kind to me, but I need\r\nsay no more about this, for I told you and your noble wife all about it\r\nyesterday, and I hate saying the same thing over and over again.\""], ["\"Sir, and all of you, farewell. Make your drink-offerings and send me on\r\nmy way rejoicing, for you have fulfilled my heart's desire by giving me\r\nan escort, and making me presents, which heaven grant that I may turn\r\nto good account; may I find my admirable wife living in peace among\r\nfriends, {109} and may you whom I leave behind me give satisfaction\r\nto your wives and children; {110} may heaven vouchsafe you every good\r\ngrace, and may no evil thing come among your people.\""], ["\"Pontonous, mix\r\nsome wine and hand it round to everybody, that we may offer a prayer to\r\nfather Jove, and speed our guest upon his way.\""], ["\"What, O Lord of the Earthquake, are you talking\r\nabout? The gods are by no means wanting in respect for you. It would\r\nbe monstrous were they to insult one so old and honoured as you are. As\r\nregards mortals, however, if any of them is indulging in insolence and\r\ntreating you disrespectfully, it will always rest with yourself to deal\r\nwith him as you may think proper, so do just as you please.\""], ["\"Bless my heart, who is it that can have\r\nrooted the ship in the sea just as she was getting into port? We could\r\nsee the whole of her only a moment ago.\""], ["\"I remember now the old prophecy of my father. He said that\r\nNeptune would be angry with us for taking every one so safely over the\r\nsea, and would one day wreck a Phaeacian ship as it was returning from\r\nan escort, and bury our city under a high mountain. This was what my old\r\nfather used to say, and now it is all coming true. {117} Now therefore\r\nlet us all do as I say; in the first place we must leave off giving\r\npeople escorts when they come here, and in the next let us sacrifice\r\ntwelve picked bulls to Neptune that he may have mercy upon us, and not\r\nbury our city under the high mountain.\""], ["\"Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have come\r\nfrom somewhere a long way off, not to know what country this is. It is\r\na very celebrated place, and everybody knows it East and West. It is\r\nrugged and not a good driving country, but it is by no means a bad\r\nisland for what there is of it. It grows any quantity of corn and also\r\nwine, for it is watered both by rain and dew; it breeds cattle also\r\nand goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and there are watering places\r\nwhere the water never runs dry; so, sir, the name of Ithaca is known\r\neven as far as Troy, which I understand to be a long way off from this\r\nAchaean country.\""], ["\"A man, goddess, may know a great deal, but you\r\nare so constantly changing your appearance that when he meets you it\r\nis a hard matter for him to know whether it is you or not. This much,\r\nhowever, I know exceedingly well; you were very kind to me as long as we\r\nAchaeans were fighting before Troy, but from the day on which we went on\r\nboard ship after having sacked the city of Priam, and heaven dispersed\r\nus--from that day, Minerva, I saw no more of you, and cannot ever\r\nremember your coming to my ship to help me in a difficulty; I had to\r\nwander on sick and sorry till the gods delivered me from evil and I\r\nreached the city of the Phaeacians, where you encouraged me and took me\r\ninto the town. {120} And now, I beseech you in your father's name, tell\r\nme the truth, for I do not believe I am really back in Ithaca. I am in\r\nsome other country and you are mocking me and deceiving me in all you\r\nhave been saying. Tell me then truly, have I really got back to my own\r\ncountry?\""], ["\"Naiad nymphs, daughters of Jove, I made sure that I was never\r\nagain to see you, now therefore I greet you with all loving salutations,\r\nand I will bring you offerings as in the old days, if Jove's redoubtable\r\ndaughter will grant me life, and bring my son to manhood.\""], ["\"In good truth, goddess, it seems I should have\r\ncome to much the same bad end in my own house as Agamemnon did, if you\r\nhad not given me such timely information. Advise me how I shall best\r\navenge myself. Stand by my side and put your courage into my heart as on\r\nthe day when we loosed Troy's fair diadem from her brow. Help me now as\r\nyou did then, and I will fight three hundred men, if you, goddess, will\r\nbe with me.\""], ["\"Never mind about him, I sent him that he might be\r\nwell spoken of for having gone. He is in no sort of difficulty, but\r\nis staying quite comfortably with Menelaus, and is surrounded with\r\nabundance of every kind. The suitors have put out to sea and are lying\r\nin wait for him, for they mean to kill him before he can get home. I do\r\nnot much think they will succeed, but rather that some of those who are\r\nnow eating up your estate will first find a grave themselves.\""], ["\"Old\r\nman, the dogs were likely to have made short work of you, and then you\r\nwould have got me into trouble. The gods have given me quite enough\r\nworries without that, for I have lost the best of masters, and am in\r\ncontinual grief on his account. I have to attend swine for other people\r\nto eat, while he, if he yet lives to see the light of day, is starving\r\nin some distant land. But come inside, and when you have had your fill\r\nof bread and wine, tell me where you come from, and all about your\r\nmisfortunes.\""], ["\"May Jove, sir, and the rest of the gods grant you your heart's\r\ndesire in return for the kind way in which you have received me.\""], ["\"Stranger, though a still\r\npoorer man should come here, it would not be right for me to insult him,\r\nfor all strangers and beggars are from Jove. You must take what you\r\ncan get and be thankful, for servants live in fear when they have young\r\nlords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now, for heaven has\r\nhindered the return of him who would have been always good to me and\r\ngiven me something of my own--a house, a piece of land, a good looking\r\nwife, and all else that a liberal master allows a servant who has worked\r\nhard for him, and whose labour the gods have prospered as they have mine\r\nin the situation which I hold. If my master had grown old here he would\r\nhave done great things by me, but he is gone, and I wish that Helen's\r\nwhole race were utterly destroyed, for she has been the death of many a\r\ngood man. It was this matter that took my master to Ilius, the land of\r\nnoble steeds, to fight the Trojans in the cause of king Agamemnon.\""], ["\"My friend, who was this master of yours\r\nthat bought you and paid for you, so rich and so powerful as you tell\r\nme? You say he perished in the cause of King Agamemnon; tell me who he\r\nwas, in case I may have met with such a person. Jove and the other gods\r\nknow, but I may be able to give you news of him, for I have travelled\r\nmuch.\""], ["\"Old man, no traveller who comes here with news will\r\nget Ulysses' wife and son to believe his story. Nevertheless, tramps in\r\nwant of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full of lies, and not a\r\nword of truth; every one who finds his way to Ithaca goes to my mistress\r\nand tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes them in, makes much of them,\r\nand asks them all manner of questions, crying all the time as women will\r\nwhen they have lost their husbands. And you too, old man, for a shirt\r\nand a cloak would doubtless make up a very pretty story. But the wolves\r\nand birds of prey have long since torn Ulysses to pieces, or the fishes\r\nof the sea have eaten him, and his bones are lying buried deep in sand\r\nupon some foreign shore; he is dead and gone, and a bad business it is\r\nfor all his friends--for me especially; go where I may I shall never\r\nfind so good a master, not even if I were to go home to my mother and\r\nfather where I was bred and born. I do not so much care, however, about\r\nmy parents now, though I should dearly like to see them again in my own\r\ncountry; it is the loss of Ulysses that grieves me most; I cannot speak\r\nof him without reverence though he is here no longer, for he was very\r\nfond of me, and took such care of me that wherever he may be I shall\r\nalways honour his memory.\""], ["\"Old man, you will neither\r\nget paid for bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come home; drink\r\nyour wine in peace, and let us talk about something else. Do not keep on\r\nreminding me of all this; it always pains me when any one speaks about\r\nmy honoured master. As for your oath we will let it alone, but I only\r\nwish he may come, as do Penelope, his old father Laertes, and his son\r\nTelemachus. I am terribly unhappy too about this same boy of his; he was\r\nrunning up fast into manhood, and bade fare to be no worse man, face\r\nand figure, than his father, but some one, either god or man, has been\r\nunsettling his mind, so he has gone off to Pylos to try and get news of\r\nhis father, and the suitors are lying in wait for him as he is coming\r\nhome, in the hope of leaving the house of Arceisius without a name in\r\nIthaca. But let us say no more about him, and leave him to be taken, or\r\nelse to escape if the son of Saturn holds his hand over him to protect\r\nhim. And now, old man, tell me your own story; tell me also, for I want\r\nto know, who you are and where you come from. Tell me of your town\r\nand parents, what manner of ship you came in, how crew brought you to\r\nIthaca, and from what country they professed to come--for you cannot\r\nhave come by land.\""], ["\"These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me to the\r\nvery extreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out from land\r\nthey resolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me of the shirt\r\nand cloak that I was wearing, and gave me instead the tattered old\r\nclouts in which you now see me; then, towards nightfall, they reached\r\nthe tilled lands of Ithaca, and there they bound me with a strong rope\r\nfast in the ship, while they went on shore to get supper by the sea\r\nside. But the gods soon undid my bonds for me, and having drawn my rags\r\nover my head I slid down the rudder into the sea, where I struck out and\r\nswam till I was well clear of them, and came ashore near a thick wood\r\nin which I lay concealed. They were very angry at my having escaped and\r\nwent searching about for me, till at last they thought it was no further\r\nuse and went back to their ship. The gods, having hidden me thus easily,\r\nthen took me to a good man's door--for it seems that I am not to die yet\r\nawhile.\""], ["\"As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never go to the\r\ntown unless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some news\r\nabout Ulysses. Then they all sit round and ask questions, both those who\r\ngrieve over the king's absence, and those who rejoice at it because they\r\ncan eat up his property without paying for it. For my own part I have\r\nnever cared about asking anyone else since the time when I was taken in\r\nby an Aetolian, who had killed a man and come a long way till at last\r\nhe reached my station, and I was very kind to him. He said he had seen\r\nUlysses with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting his ships which had\r\nbeen damaged in a gale. He said Ulysses would return in the following\r\nsummer or autumn with his men, and that he would bring back much wealth.\r\nAnd now you, you unfortunate old man, since fate has brought you to my\r\ndoor, do not try to flatter me in this way with vain hopes. It is not\r\nfor any such reason that I shall treat you kindly, but only out of\r\nrespect for Jove the god of hospitality, as fearing him and pitying\r\nyou.\""], ["\"I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have\r\ngiven you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make a\r\nbargain, and call all the gods in heaven to witness it. If your master\r\ncomes home, give me a cloak and shirt of good wear, and send me to\r\nDulichium where I want to go; but if he does not come as I say he will,\r\nset your men on to me, and tell them to throw me from yonder precipice,\r\nas a warning to tramps not to go about the country telling lies.\""], ["\"Bring in the best pig you have,\r\nthat I may sacrifice him for this stranger, and we will take toll of him\r\nourselves. We have had trouble enough this long time feeding pigs, while\r\nothers reap the fruit of our labour.\""], ["\"Eat, my good fellow, and\r\nenjoy your supper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that,\r\njust as he thinks right, for he can do whatever he chooses.\""], ["\"Listen to me,\""], ["\"On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running\r\nto the ships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough\r\ntill morning. Would that I were still young and strong as I was in those\r\ndays, for then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak both out\r\nof good will and for the respect due to a brave soldier; but now people\r\nlook down upon me because my clothes are shabby.\""], ["\"Old man, you have told us an excellent story,\r\nand have said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the\r\npresent, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything else\r\nthat a stranger in distress may reasonably expect, but to-morrow morning\r\nyou have to shake your own old rags about your body again, for we have\r\nnot many spare cloaks nor shirts up here, but every man has only one.\r\nWhen Ulysses' son comes home again he will give you both cloak and\r\nshirt, and send you wherever you may want to go.\""], ["\"Telemachus, you should not remain so far away from home any longer, nor\r\nleave your property with such dangerous people in your house; they\r\nwill eat up everything you have among them, and you will have been on a\r\nfool's errand. Ask Menelaus to send you home at once if you wish to\r\nfind your excellent mother still there when you get back. Her father and\r\nbrothers are already urging her to marry Eurymachus, who has given her\r\nmore than any of the others, and has been greatly increasing his wedding\r\npresents. I hope nothing valuable may have been taken from the house in\r\nspite of you, but you know what women are--they always want to do the\r\nbest they can for the man who marries them, and never give another\r\nthought to the children of their first husband, nor to their father\r\neither when he is dead and done with. Go home, therefore, and put\r\neverything in charge of the most respectable woman servant that you\r\nhave, until it shall please heaven to send you a wife of your own. Let\r\nme tell you also of another matter which you had better attend to. The\r\nchief men among the suitors are lying in wait for you in the Strait\r\n{128} between Ithaca and Samos, and they mean to kill you before you\r\ncan reach home. I do not much think they will succeed; it is more likely\r\nthat some of those who are now eating up your property will find a grave\r\nthemselves. Sail night and day, and keep your ship well away from the\r\nislands; the god who watches over you and protects you will send you a\r\nfair wind. As soon as you get to Ithaca send your ship and men on to the\r\ntown, but yourself go straight to the swineherd who has charge of your\r\npigs; he is well disposed towards you, stay with him, therefore, for the\r\nnight, and then send him to Penelope to tell her that you have got back\r\nsafe from Pylos.\""], ["\"Wake up Pisistratus, and yoke the\r\nhorses to the chariot, for we must set off home.\""], ["\"No matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive\r\nin the dark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaus has brought his\r\npresents and put them in the chariot for us; and let him say good bye to\r\nus in the usual way. So long as he lives a guest should never forget a\r\nhost who has shown him kindness.\""], ["\"Telemachus, if you insist on going I will not\r\ndetain you. I do not like to see a host either too fond of his guest or\r\ntoo rude to him. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting a\r\nman go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if he would\r\nlike to stay. One should treat a guest well as long as he is in the\r\nhouse and speed him when he wants to leave it. Wait, then, till I\r\ncan get your beautiful presents into your chariot, and till you have\r\nyourself seen them. I will tell the women to prepare a sufficient dinner\r\nfor you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once more\r\nproper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting out on\r\nsuch a long journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy for making a tour\r\nin Hellas or in the Peloponnese, I will yoke my horses, and will conduct\r\nyou myself through all our principal cities. No one will send us away\r\nempty handed; every one will give us something--a bronze tripod, a\r\ncouple of mules, or a gold cup.\""], ["\"Telemachus, may Jove, the mighty husband of Juno, bring you safely home\r\naccording to your desire. I will now present you with the finest and\r\nmost precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing bowl of\r\npure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold, and it is the\r\nwork of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians made me a present of it\r\nin the course of a visit that I paid him while I was on my return home.\r\nI should like to give it to you.\""], ["\"Farewell to both of\r\nyou; see that you tell Nestor how I have treated you, for he was as\r\nkind to me as any father could be while we Achaeans were fighting before\r\nTroy.\""], ["\"Tell me, Menelaus, has\r\nheaven sent this omen for us or for you?\""], ["\"I will read this matter\r\nas heaven has put it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it will come\r\nto pass. The eagle came from the mountain where it was bred and has\r\nits nest, and in like manner Ulysses, after having travelled far and\r\nsuffered much, will return to take his revenge--if indeed he is not back\r\nalready and hatching mischief for the suitors.\""], ["\"Pisistratus, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to ask you.\r\nYou know our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we are both\r\nof an age, and this journey has brought us together still more closely;\r\ndo not, therefore, take me past my ship, but leave me there, for if I go\r\nto your father's house he will try to keep me in the warmth of his good\r\nwill towards me, and I must go home at once.\""], ["\"Go on board at once and tell your men to do so also before\r\nI can reach home to tell my father. I know how obstinate he is, and am\r\nsure he will not let you go; he will come down here to fetch you, and he\r\nwill not go back without you. But he will be very angry.\""], ["\"I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca, and\r\nmy father is Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. But he has come\r\nto some miserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and got my crew\r\ntogether to see if I can hear any news of him, for he has been away a\r\nlong time.\""], ["\"Eumaeus, and all of you, to-morrow I want to go away and begin begging\r\nabout the town, so as to be no more trouble to you or to your men. Give\r\nme your advice therefore, and let me have a good guide to go with me\r\nand show me the way. I will go the round of the city begging as I needs\r\nmust, to see if any one will give me a drink and a piece of bread. I\r\nshould like also to go to the house of Ulysses and bring news of her\r\nhusband to Queen Penelope. I could then go about among the suitors and\r\nsee if out of all their abundance they will give me a dinner. I should\r\nsoon make them an excellent servant in all sorts of ways. Listen and\r\nbelieve when I tell you that by the blessing of Mercury who gives grace\r\nand good name to the works of all men, there is no one living who would\r\nmake a more handy servant than I should--to put fresh wood on the fire,\r\nchop fuel, carve, cook, pour out wine, and do all those services that\r\npoor men have to do for their betters.\""], ["\"I hope you may be as dear to the gods as you are to\r\nme, for having saved me from going about and getting into trouble; there\r\nis nothing worse than being always on the tramp; still, when men have\r\nonce got low down in the world they will go through a great deal on\r\nbehalf of their miserable bellies. Since, however, you press me to stay\r\nhere and await the return of Telemachus, tell me about Ulysses' mother,\r\nand his father whom he left on the threshold of old age when he set\r\nout for Troy. Are they still living or are they already dead and in the\r\nhouse of Hades?\""], ["\"Then you must have been a very little fellow,\r\nEumaeus, when you were taken so far away from your home and parents.\r\nTell me, and tell me true, was the city in which your father and mother\r\nlived sacked and pillaged, or did some enemies carry you off when you\r\nwere alone tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, and sell you for\r\nwhatever your master gave them?\""], ["\"Stranger,\""], ["\"On this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed a whole\r\nyear till they had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise,\r\nand then, when they had got freight enough, they sent to tell the\r\nwoman. Their messenger, a very cunning fellow, came to my father's house\r\nbringing a necklace of gold with amber beads strung among it; and\r\nwhile my mother and the servants had it in their hands admiring it and\r\nbargaining about it, he made a sign quietly to the woman and then went\r\nback to the ship, whereon she took me by the hand and led me out of the\r\nhouse. In the fore part of the house she saw the tables set with\r\nthe cups of guests who had been feasting with my father, as being in\r\nattendance on him; these were now all gone to a meeting of the public\r\nassembly, so she snatched up three cups and carried them off in the\r\nbosom of her dress, while I followed her, for I knew no better. The sun\r\nwas now set, and darkness was over all the land, so we hurried on as\r\nfast as we could till we reached the harbour, where the Phoenician ship\r\nwas lying. When they had got on board they sailed their ways over the\r\nsea, taking us with them, and Jove sent then a fair wind; six days did\r\nwe sail both night and day, but on the seventh day Diana struck the\r\nwoman and she fell heavily down into the ship's hold as though she were\r\na sea gull alighting on the water; so they threw her overboard to the\r\nseals and fishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently the\r\nwinds and waves took the ship to Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry of\r\nhis chattels for me, and thus it was that ever I came to set eyes upon\r\nthis country.\""], ["\"Eumaeus, I have heard the story of your misfortunes\r\nwith the most lively interest and pity, but Jove has given you good as\r\nwell as evil, for in spite of everything you have a good master, who\r\nsees that you always have enough to eat and drink; and you lead a good\r\nlife, whereas I am still going about begging my way from city to city.\""], ["\"Take the ship on to the town, but\r\nleave me here, for I want to look after the herdsmen on one of my farms.\r\nIn the evening, when I have seen all I want, I will come down to the\r\ncity, and to-morrow morning in return for your trouble I will give you\r\nall a good dinner with meat and wine.\""], ["\"And what, my dear young friend, is to become of\r\nme? To whose house, among all your chief men, am I to repair? or shall I\r\ngo straight to your own house and to your mother?\""], ["\"Piraeus, son of Clytius, you have\r\nthroughout shown yourself the most willing to serve me of all those who\r\nhave accompanied me to Pylos; I wish you would take this stranger to\r\nyour own house and entertain him hospitably till I can come for him.\""], ["\"Telemachus, you may stay away as long as you\r\nplease, but I will look after him for you, and he shall find no lack of\r\nhospitality.\""], ["\"Eumaeus, I hear footsteps; I suppose one of your men or some one of\r\nyour acquaintance is coming here, for the dogs are fawning upon him and\r\nnot barking.\""], ["\"So you are come, Telemachus, light of my eyes that you are. When I\r\nheard you had gone to Pylos I made sure I was never going to see you any\r\nmore. Come in, my dear child, and sit down, that I may have a good look\r\nat you now you are home again; it is not very often you come into\r\nthe country to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close to the town\r\ngenerally. I suppose you think it better to keep an eye on what the\r\nsuitors are doing.\""], ["\"Old friend, where\r\ndoes this stranger come from? How did his crew bring him to Ithaca, and\r\nwho were they?--for assuredly he did not come here by land.\""], ["\"My son, I will tell you\r\nthe real truth. He says he is a Cretan, and that he has been a great\r\ntraveller. At this moment he is running away from a Thesprotian ship,\r\nand has taken refuge at my station, so I will put him into your hands.\r\nDo whatever you like with him, only remember that he is your suppliant.\""], ["\"Sir, it is right that I should say something myself.\r\nI am much shocked about what you have said about the insolent way in\r\nwhich the suitors are behaving in despite of such a man as you are. Tell\r\nme, do you submit to such treatment tamely, or has some god set your\r\npeople against you? May you not complain of your brothers--for it is to\r\nthese that a man may look for support, however great his quarrel may be?\r\nI wish I were as young as you are and in my present mind; if I were son\r\nto Ulysses, or, indeed, Ulysses himself, I would rather some one came\r\nand cut my head off, but I would go to the house and be the bane of\r\nevery one of these men. {139} If they were too many for me--I being\r\nsingle-handed--I would rather die fighting in my own house than see such\r\ndisgraceful sights day after day, strangers grossly maltreated, and men\r\ndragging the women servants about the house in an unseemly way, wine\r\ndrawn recklessly, and bread wasted all to no purpose for an end that\r\nshall never be accomplished.\""], ["\"I will tell you truly everything. There is no\r\nenmity between me and my people, nor can I complain of brothers, to whom\r\na man may look for support however great his quarrel may be. Jove has\r\nmade us a race of only sons. Laertes was the only son of Arceisius, and\r\nUlysses only son of Laertes. I am myself the only son of Ulysses who\r\nleft me behind him when he went away, so that I have never been of any\r\nuse to him. Hence it comes that my house is in the hands of numberless\r\nmarauders; for the chiefs from all the neighbouring islands, Dulichium,\r\nSame, Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are\r\neating up my house under the pretext of paying court to my mother, who\r\nwill neither say point blank that she will not marry, nor yet bring\r\nmatters to an end, so they are making havoc of my estate, and before\r\nlong will do so with myself into the bargain. The issue, however,\r\nrests with heaven. But do you, old friend Eumaeus, go at once and tell\r\nPenelope that I am safe and have returned from Pylos. Tell it to herself\r\nalone, and then come back here without letting any one else know, for\r\nthere are many who are plotting mischief against me.\""], ["\"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is now time for you to tell your\r\nson: do not keep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plans for the\r\ndestruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. I will not be\r\nlong in joining you, for I too am eager for the fray.\""], ["\"I am no god, why should you take me for one? I am\r\nyour father, on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at the hands\r\nof lawless men.\""], ["\"You are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vain hopes\r\nthat I may grieve the more hereafter; no mortal man could of himself\r\ncontrive to do as you have been doing, and make yourself old and young\r\nat a moment's notice, unless a god were with him. A second ago you\r\nwere old and all in rags, and now you are like some god come down from\r\nheaven.\""], ["\"Telemachus, you ought not to be so immeasurably\r\nastonished at my being really here. There is no other Ulysses who will\r\ncome hereafter. Such as I am, it is I, who after long wandering and much\r\nhardship have got home in the twentieth year to my own country. What you\r\nwonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess Minerva, who does with\r\nme whatever she will, for she can do what she pleases. At one moment she\r\nmakes me like a beggar, and the next I am a young man with good clothes\r\non my back; it is an easy matter for the gods who live in heaven to make\r\nany man look either rich or poor.\""], ["\"In what ship, my dear father, did your crew bring you to Ithaca?\r\nOf what nation did they declare themselves to be--for you cannot have\r\ncome by land?\""], ["\"Father, I have always heard of your renown\r\nboth in the field and in council, but the task you talk of is a very\r\ngreat one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; two men cannot stand\r\nagainst many and brave ones. There are not ten suitors only, nor twice\r\nten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their number at once.\r\nThere are fifty-two chosen youths from Dulichium, and they have six\r\nservants; from Same there are twenty-four; twenty young Achaeans from\r\nZacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca itself, all of them well born. They\r\nhave with them a servant Medon, a bard, and two men who can carve at\r\ntable. If we face such numbers as this, you may have bitter cause to rue\r\nyour coming, and your revenge. See whether you cannot think of some one\r\nwho would be willing to come and help us.\""], ["\"Your son, Madam, is now returned from Pylos\""], ["\"We need\r\nnot send them any message, for they are here. Some god must have told\r\nthem, or else they saw the ship go by, and could not overtake her.\""], ["\"Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best\r\nspeaker and counsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but you are\r\nnothing of the kind. Madman, why should you try to compass the death\r\nof Telemachus, and take no heed of suppliants, whose witness is Jove\r\nhimself? It is not right for you to plot thus against one another.\r\nDo you not remember how your father fled to this house in fear of the\r\npeople, who were enraged against him for having gone with some Taphian\r\npirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were at peace with us? They\r\nwanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everything he had, but Ulysses\r\nstayed their hands although they were infuriated, and now you devour his\r\nproperty without paying for it, and break my heart by wooing his wife\r\nand trying to kill his son. Leave off doing so, and stop the others\r\nalso.\""], ["\"Take heart, Queen Penelope\r\ndaughter of Icarius, and do not trouble yourself about these matters.\r\nThe man is not yet born, nor never will be, who shall lay hands upon\r\nyour son Telemachus, while I yet live to look upon the face of the\r\nearth. I say--and it shall surely be--that my spear shall be reddened\r\nwith his blood; for many a time has Ulysses taken me on his knees,\r\nheld wine up to my lips to drink, and put pieces of meat into my hands.\r\nTherefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I have, and has nothing\r\nto fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if death comes to him\r\nfrom the gods, he cannot escape it.\""], ["\"Sir, I do not want to stay here; a beggar can always\r\ndo better in town than country, for any one who likes can give him\r\nsomething. I am too old to care about remaining here at the beck and\r\ncall of a master. Therefore let this man do as you have just told him,\r\nand take me to the town as soon as I have had a warm by the fire, and\r\nthe day has got a little heat in it. My clothes are wretchedly thin, and\r\nthis frosty morning I shall be perished with cold, for you say the city\r\nis some way off.\""], ["\"Telemachus, I shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch, which I\r\nhave not ceased to water with my tears, from the day Ulysses set out for\r\nTroy with the sons of Atreus. You failed, however, to make it clear to\r\nme before the suitors came back to the house, whether or no you had been\r\nable to hear anything about the return of your father.\""], ["\"Madam, wife of Ulysses, Telemachus does not understand these things;\r\nlisten therefore to me, for I can divine them surely, and will hide\r\nnothing from you. May Jove the king of heaven be my witness, and the\r\nrites of hospitality, with that hearth of Ulysses to which I now come,\r\nthat Ulysses himself is even now in Ithaca, and, either going about the\r\ncountry or staying in one place, is enquiring into all these evil deeds\r\nand preparing a day of reckoning for the suitors. I saw an omen when I\r\nwas on the ship which meant this, and I told Telemachus about it.\""], ["\"Now then, my young masters, you have had enough sport, so\r\ncome inside that we may get dinner ready. Dinner is not a bad thing, at\r\ndinner time.\""], ["\"Stranger, I suppose you still want to go to town\r\nto-day, as my master said you were to do; for my own part I should have\r\nliked you to stay here as a station hand, but I must do as my master\r\ntells me, or he will scold me later on, and a scolding from one's master\r\nis a very serious thing. Let us then be off, for it is now broad day; it\r\nwill be night again directly and then you will find it colder.\""], ["\"You ill conditioned cur, what\r\nare you talking about? Some day or other I will put you on board ship\r\nand take you to a foreign country, where I can sell you and pocket the\r\nmoney you will fetch. I wish I were as sure that Apollo would strike\r\nTelemachus dead this very day, or that the suitors would kill him, as I\r\nam that Ulysses will never come home again.\""], ["\"Eumaeus, this house of Ulysses is a very fine place. No matter how far\r\nyou go, you will find few like it. One building keeps following on after\r\nanother. The outer court has a wall with battlements all round it; the\r\ndoors are double folding, and of good workmanship; it would be a hard\r\nmatter to take it by force of arms. I perceive, too, that there are many\r\npeople banqueting within it, for there is a smell of roast meat, and\r\nI hear a sound of music, which the gods have made to go along with\r\nfeasting.\""], ["\"You have perceived aright, as indeed you generally\r\ndo; but let us think what will be our best course. Will you go inside\r\nfirst and join the suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you wait\r\nhere and let me go in first? But do not wait long, or some one may see\r\nyou loitering about outside, and throw something at you. Consider this\r\nmatter I pray you.\""], ["\"I understand and heed. Go in first and leave\r\nme here where I am. I am quite used to being beaten and having things\r\nthrown at me. I have been so much buffeted about in war and by sea that\r\nI am case-hardened, and this too may go with the rest. But a man cannot\r\nhide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is an enemy which gives\r\nmuch trouble to all men; it is because of this that ships are fitted out\r\nto sail the seas, and to make war upon other people.\""], ["\"Eumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap: his\r\nbuild is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he only one\r\nof those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept merely for\r\nshow?\""], ["\"Take this to the stranger, and tell him to go\r\nthe round of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggar must not be\r\nshamefaced.\""], ["\"Stranger, Telemachus sends you\r\nthis, and says you are to go the round of the suitors begging, for\r\nbeggars must not be shamefaced.\""], ["\"May King Jove grant all happiness to Telemachus, and\r\nfulfil the desire of his heart.\""], ["\"Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tell you something about him, for I\r\nhave seen him before. The swineherd brought him here, but I know nothing\r\nabout the man himself, nor where he comes from.\""], ["\"Antinous, your birth is good but your words evil.\r\nIt was no doing of mine that he came here. Who is likely to invite a\r\nstranger from a foreign country, unless it be one of those who can do\r\npublic service as a seer, a healer of hurts, a carpenter, or a bard who\r\ncan charm us with his singing? Such men are welcome all the world over,\r\nbut no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry him. You are\r\nalways harder on Ulysses' servants than any of the other suitors\r\nare, and above all on me, but I do not care so long as Telemachus and\r\nPenelope are alive and here.\""], ["\"Hush, do not answer him; Antinous has the\r\nbitterest tongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse.\""], ["\"Antinous, you take as much care of\r\nmy interests as though I were your son. Why should you want to see this\r\nstranger turned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take something and give\r\nit him yourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never mind my\r\nmother, nor any of the other servants in the house; but I know you will\r\nnot do what I say, for you are more fond of eating things yourself than\r\nof giving them to other people.\""], ["\"But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged\r\nthe land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives and\r\nchildren captives. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they\r\nheard the war-cry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was\r\nfilled with soldiers horse and foot, and with the gleam of armour. Then\r\nJove spread panic among my men, and they would no longer face the enemy,\r\nfor they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians killed many of us,\r\nand took the rest alive to do forced labour for them; as for myself,\r\nthey gave me to a friend who met them, to take to Cyprus, Dmetor by\r\nname, son of Iasus, who was a great man in Cyprus. Thence I am come\r\nhither in a state of great misery.\""], ["\"What god can have sent such a pestilence to plague\r\nus during our dinner? Get out, into the open part of the court, {145}\r\nor I will give you Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and\r\nimportunity; you have begged of all the others, and they have given you\r\nlavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easy to be free\r\nwith other people's property when there is plenty of it.\""], ["\"Your looks, my fine sir,\r\nare better than your breeding; if you were in your own house you would\r\nnot spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt, for though you are in\r\nanother man's, and surrounded with abundance, you cannot find it in you\r\nto give him even a piece of bread.\""], ["\"You shall\r\npay for this before you get clear of the court.\""], ["\"Antinous, you did ill in striking that poor wretch of a tramp: it\r\nwill be worse for you if he should turn out to be some god--and we know\r\nthe gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways as people from foreign\r\ncountries, and travel about the world to see who do amiss and who\r\nrighteously.\""], ["\"Eumaeus, go and tell the stranger to come here, I\r\nwant to see him and ask him some questions. He seems to have travelled\r\nmuch, and he may have seen or heard something of my unhappy husband.\""], ["\"If these Achaeans, Madam,\r\nwould only keep quiet, you would be charmed with the history of his\r\nadventures. I had him three days and three nights with me in my hut,\r\nwhich was the first place he reached after running away from his ship,\r\nand he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes. If he had\r\nbeen the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world, on whose lips\r\nall hearers hang entranced, I could not have been more charmed as I\r\nsat in my hut and listened to him. He says there is an old friendship\r\nbetween his house and that of Ulysses, and that he comes from Crete\r\nwhere the descendants of Minos live, after having been driven hither and\r\nthither by every kind of misfortune; he also declares that he has heard\r\nof Ulysses as being alive and near at hand among the Thesprotians, and\r\nthat he is bringing great wealth home with him.\""], ["\"Go\r\nand call the stranger; did you not hear how my son sneezed just as I\r\nwas speaking? This can only mean that all the suitors are going to be\r\nkilled, and that not one of them shall escape. Furthermore I say, and\r\nlay my saying to your heart: if I am satisfied that the stranger is\r\nspeaking the truth I shall give him a shirt and cloak of good wear.\""], ["\"Father\r\nstranger, my mistress Penelope, mother of Telemachus, has sent for you;\r\nshe is in great grief, but she wishes to hear anything you can tell her\r\nabout her husband, and if she is satisfied that you are speaking the\r\ntruth, she will give you a shirt and cloak, which are the very things\r\nthat you are most in want of. As for bread, you can get enough of that\r\nto fill your belly, by begging about the town, and letting those give\r\nthat will.\""], ["\"Why do you not bring him here, Eumaeus? Is he\r\nafraid that some one will ill-treat him, or is he shy of coming inside\r\nthe house at all? Beggars should not be shamefaced.\""], ["\"The stranger is quite\r\nreasonable. He is avoiding the suitors, and is only doing what any one\r\nelse would do. He asks you to wait till sundown, and it will be much\r\nbetter, madam, that you should have him all to yourself, when you can\r\nhear him and talk to him as you will.\""], ["\"My dear sir, I will now go back to the\r\npigs, to see after your property and my own business. You will look to\r\nwhat is going on here, but above all be careful to keep out of danger,\r\nfor there are many who bear you ill will. May Jove bring them to a bad\r\nend before they do us a mischief.\""], ["\"My friend, I do you no manner of harm;\r\npeople give you a great deal, but I am not jealous. There is room enough\r\nin this doorway for the pair of us, and you need not grudge me things\r\nthat are not yours to give. You seem to be just such another tramp as\r\nmyself, but perhaps the gods will give us better luck by and by. Do not,\r\nhowever, talk too much about fighting or you will incense me, and old\r\nthough I am, I shall cover your mouth and chest with blood. I shall\r\nhave more peace tomorrow if I do, for you will not come to the house of\r\nUlysses any more.\""], ["\"You filthy glutton, you run on\r\ntrippingly like an old fish-fag. I have a good mind to lay both hands\r\nabout you, and knock your teeth out of your head like so many boar's\r\ntusks. Get ready, therefore, and let these people here stand by and\r\nlook on. You will never be able to fight one who is so much younger than\r\nyourself.\""], ["\"This is the finest sport that you\r\never saw; heaven never yet sent anything like it into this house. The\r\nstranger and Irus have quarreled and are going to fight, let us set them\r\non to do so at once.\""], ["\"Sirs, an old man like myself, worn out with suffering, cannot hold his\r\nown against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on, though\r\nI know it can only end in my getting a drubbing. You must swear, however\r\nthat none of you will give me a foul blow to favour Irus and secure him\r\nthe victory.\""], ["\"Stranger, if you have a mind to\r\nsettle with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here. Whoever\r\nstrikes you will have to fight more than one. I am host, and the other\r\nchiefs, Antinous and Eurymachus, both of them men of understanding, are\r\nof the same mind as I am.\""], ["\"The stranger has brought such a thigh out\r\nof his old rags that there will soon be nothing left of Irus.\""], ["\"You swaggering bully, you ought never to have been born at all if\r\nyou are afraid of such an old broken down creature as this tramp is.\r\nI say, therefore--and it shall surely be--if he beats you and proves\r\nhimself the better man, I shall pack you off on board ship to the\r\nmainland and send you to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes\r\nnear him. He will cut off your nose and ears, and draw out your entrails\r\nfor the dogs to eat.\""], ["\"Amphinomus, you seem to be a man of good\r\nunderstanding, as indeed you may well be, seeing whose son you are. I\r\nhave heard your father well spoken of; he is Nisus of Dulichium, a man\r\nboth brave and wealthy. They tell me you are his son, and you appear to\r\nbe a considerable person; listen, therefore, and take heed to what I am\r\nsaying. Man is the vainest of all creatures that have their being upon\r\nearth. As long as heaven vouchsafes him health and strength, he thinks\r\nthat he shall come to no harm hereafter, and even when the blessed gods\r\nbring sorrow upon him, he bears it as he needs must, and makes the best\r\nof it; for God almighty gives men their daily minds day by day. I know\r\nall about it, for I was a rich man once, and did much wrong in the\r\nstubbornness of my pride, and in the confidence that my father and my\r\nbrothers would support me; therefore let a man fear God in all things\r\nalways, and take the good that heaven may see fit to send him without\r\nvain glory. Consider the infamy of what these suitors are doing; see how\r\nthey are wasting the estate, and doing dishonour to the wife, of one who\r\nis certain to return some day, and that, too, not long hence. Nay, he\r\nwill be here soon; may heaven send you home quietly first that you may\r\nnot meet with him in the day of his coming, for once he is here the\r\nsuitors and he will not part bloodlessly.\""], ["\"Eurynome, I have changed my mind, and have a fancy to\r\nshow myself to the suitors although I detest them. I should like also to\r\ngive my son a hint that he had better not have anything more to do with\r\nthem. They speak fairly enough but they mean mischief.\""], ["\"Queen\r\nPenelope, daughter of Icarius, if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argos could\r\nsee you at this moment, you would have still more suitors in your house\r\nby tomorrow morning, for you are the most admirable woman in the whole\r\nworld both as regards personal beauty and strength of understanding.\""], ["\"Eurymachus, heaven robbed me of all my beauty\r\nwhether of face or figure when the Argives set sail for Troy and my dear\r\nhusband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs, I\r\nshould both be more respected and show a better presence to the world.\r\nAs it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions which\r\nheaven has seen fit to heap upon me. My husband foresaw it all, and when\r\nhe was leaving home he took my right wrist in his hand--'Wife,' he said,\r\n'we shall not all of us come safe home from Troy, for the Trojans fight\r\nwell both with bow and spear. They are excellent also at fighting from\r\nchariots, and nothing decides the issue of a fight sooner than this. I\r\nknow not, therefore, whether heaven will send me back to you, or whether\r\nI may not fall over there at Troy. In the meantime do you look after\r\nthings here. Take care of my father and mother as at present, and even\r\nmore so during my absence, but when you see our son growing a beard,\r\nthen marry whom you will, and leave this your present home.' This is\r\nwhat he said and now it is all coming true. A night will come when I\r\nshall have to yield myself to a marriage which I detest, for Jove has\r\ntaken from me all hope of happiness. This further grief, moreover, cuts\r\nme to the very heart. You suitors are not wooing me after the custom of\r\nmy country. When men are courting a woman who they think will be a good\r\nwife to them and who is of noble birth, and when they are each trying\r\nto win her for himself, they usually bring oxen and sheep to feast the\r\nfriends of the lady, and they make her magnificent presents, instead of\r\neating up other people's property without paying for it.\""], ["\"Queen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, take as many\r\npresents as you please from any one who will give them to you; it is not\r\nwell to refuse a present; but we will not go about our business nor stir\r\nfrom where we are, till you have married the best man among us whoever\r\nhe may be.\""], ["\"Maids, servants of Ulysses who has so long been absent, go to the queen\r\ninside the house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, and pick wool.\r\nI will hold the light for all these people. They may stay till morning,\r\nbut shall not beat me, for I can stand a great deal.\""], ["\"Stranger, will you work as a servant,\r\nif I send you to the wolds and see that you are well paid? Can you build\r\na stone fence, or plant trees? I will have you fed all the year round,\r\nand will find you in shoes and clothing. Will you go, then? Not you; for\r\nyou have got into bad ways, and do not want to work; you had rather fill\r\nyour belly by going round the country begging.\""], ["\"Sirs, are you mad? Can you\r\nnot carry your meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit has\r\npossessed you. I do not wish to drive any of you away, but you have had\r\nyour suppers, and the sooner you all go home to bed the better.\""], ["\"Do not\r\nlet us take offence; it is reasonable, so let us make no answer. Neither\r\nlet us do violence to the stranger nor to any of Ulysses' servants. Let\r\nthe cupbearer go round with the drink-offerings, that we may make them\r\nand go home to our rest. As for the stranger, let us leave Telemachus to\r\ndeal with him, for it is to his house that he has come.\""], ["\"Telemachus, we must get the armour together and take\r\nit down inside. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you have\r\nremoved it. Say that you have taken it to be out of the way of the\r\nsmoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses went\r\naway, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more\r\nparticularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over\r\ntheir wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace\r\nboth banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people\r\nto use them.\""], ["\"Nurse, shut the women up in their room, while I take\r\nthe armour that my father left behind him down into the store room. No\r\none looks after it now my father is gone, and it has got all smirched\r\nwith soot during my own boyhood. I want to take it down where the smoke\r\ncannot reach it.\""], ["\"Father, my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls, with the rafters,\r\ncrossbeams, and the supports on which they rest are all aglow as with\r\na flaming fire. Surely there is some god here who has come down from\r\nheaven.\""], ["\"Stranger,\r\ndo you mean to plague us by hanging about the house all night and spying\r\nupon the women? Be off, you wretch, outside, and eat your supper there,\r\nor you shall be driven out with a firebrand.\""], ["\"My good woman, why should you be\r\nso angry with me? Is it because I am not clean, and my clothes are all\r\nin rags, and because I am obliged to go begging about after the manner\r\nof tramps and beggars generally? I too was a rich man once, and had a\r\nfine house of my own; in those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now\r\nam, no matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I had any number of\r\nservants, and all the other things which people have who live well and\r\nare accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove to take all away from me;\r\ntherefore, woman, beware lest you too come to lose that pride and place\r\nin which you now wanton above your fellows; have a care lest you get\r\nout of favour with your mistress, and lest Ulysses should come home, for\r\nthere is still a chance that he may do so. Moreover, though he be dead\r\nas you think he is, yet by Apollo's will he has left a son behind him,\r\nTelemachus, who will note anything done amiss by the maids in the house,\r\nfor he is now no longer in his boyhood.\""], ["\"Bring a seat with a\r\nfleece upon it, for the stranger to sit upon while he tells his story,\r\nand listens to what I have to say. I wish to ask him some questions.\""], ["\"Stranger, I shall\r\nfirst ask you who and whence are you? Tell me of your town and parents.\""], ["\"Stranger, heaven robbed me of all beauty,\r\nwhether of face or figure, when the Argives set sail for Troy and my\r\ndear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs\r\nI should be both more respected and should show a better presence to\r\nthe world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions\r\nwhich heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. The chiefs from all our\r\nislands--Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus, as also from Ithaca itself,\r\nare wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I can therefore\r\nshow no attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor to people who say\r\nthat they are skilled artisans, but am all the time broken-hearted\r\nabout Ulysses. They want me to marry again at once, and I have to invent\r\nstratagems in order to deceive them. In the first place heaven put it in\r\nmy mind to set up a great tambour-frame in my room, and to begin\r\nworking upon an enormous piece of fine needlework. Then I said to them,\r\n'Sweethearts, Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry\r\nagain immediately; wait--for I would not have my skill in needlework\r\nperish unrecorded--till I have finished making a pall for the hero\r\nLaertes, to be ready against the time when death shall take him. He\r\nis very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out\r\nwithout a pall.' This was what I said, and they assented; whereon I\r\nused to keep working at my great web all day long, but at night I would\r\nunpick the stitches again by torch light. I fooled them in this way for\r\nthree years without their finding it out, but as time wore on and I was\r\nnow in my fourth year, in the waning of moons, and many days had been\r\naccomplished, those good for nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to the\r\nsuitors, who broke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry with\r\nme, so I was forced to finish my work whether I would or no. And now\r\nI do not see how I can find any further shift for getting out of this\r\nmarriage. My parents are putting great pressure upon me, and my son\r\nchafes at the ravages the suitors are making upon his estate, for he is\r\nnow old enough to understand all about it and is perfectly able to look\r\nafter his own affairs, for heaven has blessed him with an excellent\r\ndisposition. Still, notwithstanding all this, tell me who you are and\r\nwhere you come from--for you must have had father and mother of some\r\nsort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a rock.\""], ["\"Madam, wife of Ulysses, since you persist in\r\nasking me about my family, I will answer, no matter what it costs me:\r\npeople must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as long as\r\nI have, and suffered as much among as many peoples. Nevertheless, as\r\nregards your question I will tell you all you ask. There is a fair and\r\nfruitful island in mid-ocean called Crete; it is thickly peopled and\r\nthere are ninety cities in it: the people speak many different languages\r\nwhich overlap one another, for there are Achaeans, brave Eteocretans,\r\nDorians of three-fold race, and noble Pelasgi. There is a great\r\ntown there, Cnossus, where Minos reigned who every nine years had a\r\nconference with Jove himself. {152} Minos was father to Deucalion, whose\r\nson I am, for Deucalion had two sons Idomeneus and myself. Idomeneus\r\nsailed for Troy, and I, who am the younger, am called Aethon; my\r\nbrother, however, was at once the older and the more valiant of the two;\r\nhence it was in Crete that I saw Ulysses and showed him hospitality, for\r\nthe winds took him there as he was on his way to Troy, carrying him out\r\nof his course from cape Malea and leaving him in Amnisus off the cave of\r\nIlithuia, where the harbours are difficult to enter and he could hardly\r\nfind shelter from the winds that were then raging. As soon as he got\r\nthere he went into the town and asked for Idomeneus, claiming to be his\r\nold and valued friend, but Idomeneus had already set sail for Troy some\r\nten or twelve days earlier, so I took him to my own house and showed him\r\nevery kind of hospitality, for I had abundance of everything. Moreover,\r\nI fed the men who were with him with barley meal from the public store,\r\nand got subscriptions of wine and oxen for them to sacrifice to their\r\nheart's content. They stayed with me twelve days, for there was a gale\r\nblowing from the North so strong that one could hardly keep one's feet\r\non land. I suppose some unfriendly god had raised it for them, but on\r\nthe thirteenth day the wind dropped, and they got away.\""], ["\"Now,\r\nstranger, I shall put you to the test and see whether or no you really\r\ndid entertain my husband and his men, as you say you did. Tell me, then,\r\nhow he was dressed, what kind of a man he was to look at, and so also\r\nwith his companions.\""], ["\"Stranger, I was already disposed to pity you,\r\nbut henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcome in my house. It\r\nwas I who gave Ulysses the clothes you speak of. I took them out of\r\nthe store room and folded them up myself, and I gave him also the gold\r\nbrooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never welcome him home\r\nagain. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out for that detested city\r\nwhose very name I cannot bring myself even to mention.\""], ["\"Madam, wife of Ulysses, do not disfigure\r\nyourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can\r\nhardly blame you for doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and\r\nborne him children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, even\r\nthough he were a worse man than Ulysses, who they say was like a god.\r\nStill, cease your tears and listen to what I can tell you. I will hide\r\nnothing from you, and can say with perfect truth that I have lately\r\nheard of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among the\r\nThesprotians, and is bringing back much valuable treasure that he has\r\nbegged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew\r\nwere lost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and\r\nthe sun-god were angry with him because his men had slaughtered the\r\nsun-god's cattle, and they were all drowned to a man. But Ulysses\r\nstuck to the keel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of the\r\nPhaeacians, who are near of kin to the immortals, and who treated him\r\nas though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishing to\r\nescort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been here\r\nlong ago, had he not thought better to go from land to land gathering\r\nwealth; for there is no man living who is so wily as he is; there is no\r\none can compare with him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all\r\nthis, and he swore to me--making drink-offerings in his house as he did\r\nso--that the ship was by the water side and the crew found who would\r\ntake Ulysses to his own country. He sent me off first, for there\r\nhappened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing\r\nisland of Dulichium, but he showed me all the treasure Ulysses had got\r\ntogether, and he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep\r\nhis family for ten generations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to\r\nDodona that he might learn Jove's mind from the high oak tree, and know\r\nwhether after so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or in\r\nsecret. So you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is close\r\nat hand and cannot remain away from home much longer; nevertheless I\r\nwill confirm my words with an oath, and call Jove who is the first and\r\nmightiest of all gods to witness, as also that hearth of Ulysses to\r\nwhich I have now come, that all I have spoken shall surely come to pass.\r\nUlysses will return in this self same year; with the end of this moon\r\nand the beginning of the next he will be here.\""], ["\"Madam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from the\r\nday that I left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard. I will\r\nlie as I have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. Night after night\r\nhave I passed in any rough sleeping place, and waited for morning. Nor,\r\nagain, do I like having my feet washed; I shall not let any of the young\r\nhussies about your house touch my feet; but, if you have any old and\r\nrespectable woman who has gone through as much trouble as I have, I will\r\nallow her to wash them.\""], ["\"My dear child, I cannot think\r\nwhatever I am to do with you. I am certain no one was ever more\r\ngod-fearing than yourself, and yet Jove hates you. No one in the whole\r\nworld ever burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him finer hecatombs\r\nwhen you prayed you might come to a green old age yourself and see your\r\nson grow up to take after you: yet see how he has prevented you alone\r\nfrom ever getting back to your own home. I have no doubt the women in\r\nsome foreign palace which Ulysses has got to are gibing at him as all\r\nthese sluts here have been gibing at you. I do not wonder at your\r\nnot choosing to let them wash you after the manner in which they have\r\ninsulted you; I will wash your feet myself gladly enough, as Penelope\r\nhas said that I am to do so; I will wash them both for Penelope's\r\nsake and for your own, for you have raised the most lively feelings of\r\ncompassion in my mind; and let me say this moreover, which pray attend\r\nto; we have had all kinds of strangers in distress come here before now,\r\nbut I make bold to say that no one ever yet came who was so like Ulysses\r\nin figure, voice, and feet as you are.\""], ["\"Autolycus, you must find a name for\r\nyour grandson; you greatly wished that you might have one.\""], ["\"My dear child, I am sure you must be Ulysses\r\nhimself, only I did not know you till I had actually touched and handled\r\nyou.\""], ["\"Nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you who nursed me at your own\r\nbreast, now that after twenty years of wandering I am at last come to\r\nmy own home again? Since it has been borne in upon you by heaven to\r\nrecognise me, hold your tongue, and do not say a word about it to any\r\none else in the house, for if you do I tell you--and it shall surely\r\nbe--that if heaven grants me to take the lives of these suitors, I will\r\nnot spare you, though you are my own nurse, when I am killing the other\r\nwomen.\""], ["\"Nurse, you ought not to speak in that way; I am\r\nwell able to form my own opinion about one and all of them; hold your\r\ntongue and leave everything to heaven.\""], ["\"Stranger, I should like to speak with you briefly about another matter.\r\nIt is indeed nearly bed time--for those, at least, who can sleep in\r\nspite of sorrow. As for myself, heaven has given me a life of such\r\nunmeasurable woe, that even by day when I am attending to my duties and\r\nlooking after the servants, I am still weeping and lamenting during the\r\nwhole time; then, when night comes, and we all of us go to bed, I lie\r\nawake thinking, and my heart becomes a prey to the most incessant and\r\ncruel tortures. As the dun nightingale, daughter of Pandareus, sings in\r\nthe early spring from her seat in shadiest covert hid, and with many\r\na plaintive trill pours out the tale how by mishap she killed her own\r\nchild Itylus, son of king Zethus, even so does my mind toss and turn in\r\nits uncertainty whether I ought to stay with my son here, and safeguard\r\nmy substance, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my house, out of regard\r\nto public opinion and the memory of my late husband, or whether it is\r\nnot now time for me to go with the best of these suitors who are wooing\r\nme and making me such magnificent presents. As long as my son was still\r\nyoung, and unable to understand, he would not hear of my leaving my\r\nhusband's house, but now that he is full grown he begs and prays me to\r\ndo so, being incensed at the way in which the suitors are eating up his\r\nproperty. Listen, then, to a dream that I have had and interpret it for\r\nme if you can. I have twenty geese about the house that eat mash out\r\nof a trough, {155} and of which I am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a\r\ngreat eagle came swooping down from a mountain, and dug his curved beak\r\ninto the neck of each of them till he had killed them all. Presently\r\nhe soared off into the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard;\r\nwhereon I wept in my dream till all my maids gathered round me, so\r\npiteously was I grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. Then he\r\ncame back again, and perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with\r\nhuman voice, and told me to leave off crying. 'Be of good courage,' he\r\nsaid, 'daughter of Icarius; this is no dream, but a vision of good omen\r\nthat shall surely come to pass. The geese are the suitors, and I am no\r\nlonger an eagle, but your own husband, who am come back to you, and who\r\nwill bring these suitors to a disgraceful end.' On this I woke, and when\r\nI looked out I saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as usual.\""], ["\"Stranger, dreams are very curious and\r\nunaccountable things, and they do not by any means invariably come true.\r\nThere are two gates through which these unsubstantial fancies proceed;\r\nthe one is of horn, and the other ivory. Those that come through\r\nthe gate of ivory are fatuous, but those from the gate of horn mean\r\nsomething to those that see them. I do not think, however, that my own\r\ndream came through the gate of horn, though I and my son should be most\r\nthankful if it proves to have done so. Furthermore I say--and lay my\r\nsaying to your heart--the coming dawn will usher in the ill-omened day\r\nthat is to sever me from the house of Ulysses, for I am about to hold a\r\ntournament of axes. My husband used to set up twelve axes in the court,\r\none in front of the other, like the stays upon which a ship is built;\r\nhe would then go back from them and shoot an arrow through the whole\r\ntwelve. I shall make the suitors try to do the same thing, and whichever\r\nof them can string the bow most easily, and send his arrow through all\r\nthe twelve axes, him will I follow, and quit this house of my lawful\r\nhusband, so goodly and so abounding in wealth. But even so, I doubt not\r\nthat I shall remember it in my dreams.\""], ["\"Madam, wife of Ulysses, you need not defer your\r\ntournament, for Ulysses will return ere ever they can string the bow,\r\nhandle it how they will, and send their arrows through the iron.\""], ["\"As long, sir, as you will sit here and talk\r\nto me, I can have no desire to go to bed. Still, people cannot do\r\npermanently without sleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers on earth\r\na time for all things. I will therefore go upstairs and recline upon\r\nthat couch which I have never ceased to flood with my tears from the day\r\nUlysses set out for the city with a hateful name.\""], ["\"Heart, be still, you had worse than this to bear on the day when the\r\nterrible Cyclops ate your brave companions; yet you bore it in silence\r\ntill your cunning got you safe out of the cave, though you made sure of\r\nbeing killed.\""], ["\"My poor unhappy man, why do you lie\r\nawake in this way? This is your house: your wife is safe inside it, and\r\nso is your son who is just such a young man as any father may be proud\r\nof.\""], ["\"Great Goddess Diana, daughter of Jove, drive an\r\narrow into my heart and slay me; or let some whirlwind snatch me up and\r\nbear me through paths of darkness till it drop me into the mouths\r\nof over-flowing Oceanus, as it did the daughters of Pandareus. The\r\ndaughters of Pandareus lost their father and mother, for the gods killed\r\nthem, so they were left orphans. But Venus took care of them, and fed\r\nthem on cheese, honey, and sweet wine. Juno taught them to excel all\r\nwomen in beauty of form and understanding; Diana gave them an imposing\r\npresence, and Minerva endowed them with every kind of accomplishment;\r\nbut one day when Venus had gone up to Olympus to see Jove about getting\r\nthem married (for well does he know both what shall happen and what\r\nnot happen to every one) the storm winds came and spirited them away to\r\nbecome handmaids to the dread Erinyes. Even so I wish that the gods who\r\nlive in heaven would hide me from mortal sight, or that fair Diana might\r\nstrike me, for I would fain go even beneath the sad earth if I might\r\ndo so still looking towards Ulysses only, and without having to yield\r\nmyself to a worse man than he was. Besides, no matter how much people\r\nmay grieve by day, they can put up with it so long as they can sleep at\r\nnight, for when the eyes are closed in slumber people forget good and\r\nill alike; whereas my misery haunts me even in my dreams. This very\r\nnight methought there was one lying by my side who was like Ulysses as\r\nhe was when he went away with his host, and I rejoiced, for I believed\r\nthat it was no dream, but the very truth itself.\""], ["\"Father Jove, since you have seen fit to bring me over land and\r\nsea to my own home after all the afflictions you have laid upon me, give\r\nme a sign out of the mouth of some one or other of those who are now\r\nwaking within the house, and let me have another sign of some kind from\r\noutside.\""], ["\"Nurse, did you make the\r\nstranger comfortable both as regards bed and board, or did you let him\r\nshift for himself?--for my mother, good woman though she is, has a\r\nway of paying great attention to second-rate people, and of neglecting\r\nothers who are in reality much better men.\""], ["\"Come, wake up; set about sweeping the cloisters and sprinkling\r\nthem with water to lay the dust; put the covers on the seats; wipe down\r\nthe tables, some of you, with a wet sponge; clean out the mixing-jugs\r\nand the cups, and go for water from the fountain at once; the suitors\r\nwill be here directly; they will be here early, for it is a feast day.\""], ["\"Stranger, are the suitors treating you\r\nany better now, or are they as insolent as ever?\""], ["\"My friends,\r\nthis plot of ours to murder Telemachus will not succeed; let us go to\r\ndinner instead.\""], ["\"We do not like such language but we will put up\r\nwith it, for Telemachus is threatening us in good earnest. If Jove had\r\nlet us we should have put a stop to his brave talk ere now.\""], ["\"Hear what I have to say. The stranger has already had as\r\nlarge a portion as any one else; this is well, for it is not right nor\r\nreasonable to ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes here. I\r\nwill, however, make him a present on my own account, that he may have\r\nsomething to give to the bath-woman, or to some other of Ulysses'\r\nservants.\""], ["\"No\r\none should take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay it, for\r\nit is quite reasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating the stranger,\r\nor any one else of the servants who are about the house; I would say,\r\nhowever, a friendly word to Telemachus and his mother, which I trust may\r\ncommend itself to both. 'As long,' I would say, 'as you had ground for\r\nhoping that Ulysses would one day come home, no one could complain of\r\nyour waiting and suffering {160} the suitors to be in your house. It\r\nwould have been better that he should have returned, but it is now\r\nsufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore talk all this\r\nquietly over with your mother, and tell her to marry the best man,\r\nand the one who makes her the most advantageous offer. Thus you will\r\nyourself be able to manage your own inheritance, and to eat and drink\r\nin peace, while your mother will look after some other man's house, not\r\nyours.'\""], ["\"By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows of my\r\nunhappy father, who has either perished far from Ithaca, or is wandering\r\nin some distant land, I throw no obstacles in the way of my mother's\r\nmarriage; on the contrary I urge her to choose whomsoever she will, and\r\nI will give her numberless gifts into the bargain, but I dare not insist\r\npoint blank that she shall leave the house against her own wishes.\r\nHeaven forbid that I should do this.\""], ["\"Unhappy men, what is it that ails you? There is a shroud\r\nof darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your cheeks are wet with\r\ntears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and roof-beams\r\ndrip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are full\r\nof ghosts trooping down into the night of hell; the sun is blotted out\r\nof heaven, and a blighting gloom is over all the land.\""], ["\"This stranger who has lately come here has lost his senses.\r\nServants, turn him out into the streets, since he finds it so dark\r\nhere.\""], ["\"Eurymachus, you need not send any one with me.\r\nI have eyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing of an\r\nunderstanding mind. I will take these out of the house with me, for\r\nI see mischief overhanging you, from which not one of you men who are\r\ninsulting people and plotting ill deeds in the house of Ulysses will be\r\nable to escape.\""], ["\"Telemachus, you are not happy in your guests; first you have this\r\nimportunate tramp, who comes begging bread and wine and has no skill\r\nfor work or for hard fighting, but is perfectly useless, and now here is\r\nanother fellow who is setting himself up as a prophet. Let me persuade\r\nyou, for it will be much better to put them on board ship and send them\r\noff to the Sicels to sell for what they will bring.\""], ["\"Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality of\r\nthis house because its owner has been long absent, and without other\r\npretext than that you want to marry me; this, then, being the prize that\r\nyou are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow of Ulysses, and\r\nwhomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send his arrow through\r\neach one of twelve axes, him will I follow and quit this house of my\r\nlawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding in wealth. But even so I\r\ndoubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.\""], ["\"Alas!

Some one of us is even now hoping\r\nand praying that he may marry Penelope, but when he has seen this bow\r\nand tried it, let him woo and make bridal offerings to some other woman,\r\nand let Penelope marry whoever makes her the best offer and whose lot it\r\nis to win her.\""], ["\"Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and\r\nintolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this bow\r\ntake the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bend\r\nit yourself? True, you were not born to be an archer, but there are\r\nothers who will soon string it.\""], ["\"Look sharp, light a fire in\r\nthe court, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us also\r\na large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let us warm the\r\nbow and grease it--we will then make trial of it again, and bring the\r\ncontest to an end.\""], ["\"Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I am in\r\ndoubt whether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What manner of\r\nmen would you be to stand by Ulysses, if some god should bring him back\r\nhere all of a sudden? Say which you are disposed to do--to side with the\r\nsuitors, or with Ulysses?\""], ["\"It is I, Ulysses, who am here. I have suffered much, but at last,\r\nin the twentieth year, I am come back to my own country. I find that you\r\ntwo alone of all my servants are glad that I should do so, for I\r\nhave not heard any of the others praying for my return. To you two,\r\ntherefore, will I unfold the truth as it shall be. If heaven shall\r\ndeliver the suitors into my hands, I will find wives for both of you,\r\nwill give you house and holding close to my own, and you shall be to me\r\nas though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus. I will now give\r\nyou convincing proofs that you may know me and be assured. See, here is\r\nthe scar from the boar's tooth that ripped me when I was out hunting on\r\nMt.

If they hear any\r\ngroaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they must not\r\ncome out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they are at their work.\r\nAnd I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast the doors of the outer court,\r\nand to bind them securely at once.\""], ["\"I grieve for myself and for us\r\nall; I grieve that I shall have to forgo the marriage, but I do not care\r\nnearly so much about this, for there are plenty of other women in Ithaca\r\nand elsewhere; what I feel most is the fact of our being so inferior to\r\nUlysses in strength that we cannot string his bow. This will disgrace us\r\nin the eyes of those who are yet unborn.\""], ["\"Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as I am\r\nminded. I appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous who\r\nhas just spoken with so much reason. Cease shooting for the present and\r\nleave the matter to the gods, but in the morning let heaven give victory\r\nto whom it will. For the moment, however, give me the bow that I may\r\nprove the power of my hands among you all, and see whether I still have\r\nas much strength as I used to have, or whether travel and neglect have\r\nmade an end of it.\""], ["\"Wretched creature, you\r\nhave not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought\r\nto think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your\r\nbetters, without having any smaller portion served you than we others\r\nhave had, and in being allowed to hear our conversation. No other beggar\r\nor stranger has been allowed to hear what we say among ourselves; the\r\nwine must have been doing you a mischief, as it does with all those who\r\ndrink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the Centaur Eurytion when\r\nhe was staying with Peirithous among the Lapithae. When the wine had\r\ngot into his head, he went mad and did ill deeds about the house of\r\nPeirithous; this angered the heroes who were there assembled, so they\r\nrushed at him and cut off his ears and nostrils; then they dragged him\r\nthrough the doorway out of the house, so he went away crazed, and bore\r\nthe burden of his crime, bereft of understanding. Henceforth, therefore,\r\nthere was war between mankind and the centaurs, but he brought it upon\r\nhimself through his own drunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that\r\nit will go hardly with you if you string the bow: you will find no mercy\r\nfrom any one here, for we shall at once ship you off to king Echetus,\r\nwho kills every one that comes near him: you will never get away alive,\r\nso drink and keep quiet without getting into a quarrel with men younger\r\nthan yourself.\""], ["\"Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca or in\r\nthe islands that are over against Elis who has the right to let any\r\none have the bow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one way or the\r\nother, not even though I choose to make the stranger a present of the\r\nbow outright, and let him take it away with him.

There is no man living, however strong and\r\nin his prime, who could move it from its place, for it is a marvellous\r\ncuriosity which I made with my very own hands. There was a young olive\r\ngrowing within the precincts of the house, in full vigour, and about as\r\nthick as a bearing-post. I built my room round this with strong walls\r\nof stone and a roof to cover them, and I made the doors strong and\r\nwell-fitting. Then I cut off the top boughs of the olive tree and left\r\nthe stump standing. This I dressed roughly from the root upwards and\r\nthen worked with carpenter's tools well and skilfully, straightening\r\nmy work by drawing a line on the wood, and making it into a bed-prop.\r\nI then bored a hole down the middle, and made it the centre-post of my\r\nbed, at which I worked till I had finished it, inlaying it with gold and\r\nsilver; after this I stretched a hide of crimson leather from one side\r\nof it to the other.

Thus even in death\r\nyour fame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives evermore\r\namong all mankind. But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my\r\nfighting were done? For Jove willed my destruction on my return, by the\r\nhands of Aegisthus and those of my wicked wife.\""], ["\"Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm where his\r\nswineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son, returning from\r\na voyage to Pylos, and the two came to the town when they had hatched\r\ntheir plot for our destruction. Telemachus came first, and then after\r\nhim, accompanied by the swineherd, came Ulysses, clad in rags and\r\nleaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar. He came\r\nso unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the older ones among\r\nus, and we reviled him and threw things at him. He endured both being\r\nstruck and insulted without a word, though he was in his own house; but\r\nwhen the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspired him, he and Telemachus\r\ntook the armour and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting the doors behind\r\nthem. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a quantity\r\nof iron to be contended for by us ill-fated suitors; and this was the\r\nbeginning of our end, for not one of us could string the bow--nor nearly\r\ndo so. When it was about to reach the hands of Ulysses, we all of us\r\nshouted out that it should not be given him, no matter what he might\r\nsay, but Telemachus insisted on his having it. When he had got it in his\r\nhands he strung it with ease and sent his arrow through the iron. Then\r\nhe stood on the floor of the cloister and poured his arrows on the\r\nground, glaring fiercely about him. First he killed Antinous, and then,\r\naiming straight before him, he let fly his deadly darts and they fell\r\nthick on one another. It was plain that some one of the gods was\r\nhelping them, for they fell upon us with might and main throughout the\r\ncloisters, and there was a hideous sound of groaning as our brains\r\nwere being battered in, and the ground seethed with our blood. This,\r\nAgamemnon, is how we came by our end, and our bodies are lying still\r\nuncared for in the house of Ulysses, for our friends at home do not\r\nyet know what has happened, so that they cannot lay us out and wash\r\nthe black blood from our wounds, making moan over us according to the\r\noffices due to the departed.\""], ["\"Go to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner.\r\nMeanwhile I want to see whether my father will know me, or fail to\r\nrecognise me after so long an absence.\""], ["\"Sir, you have indeed come to the\r\ncountry that you have named, but it is fallen into the hands of wicked\r\npeople.

If you see them ill treating me, steel your heart\r\nagainst my sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost out of\r\nthe house, or throw things at me, look on and do nothing beyond gently\r\ntrying to make them behave more reasonably; but they will not listen to\r\nyou, for the day of their reckoning is at hand. Furthermore I say, and\r\nlay my saying to your heart; when Minerva shall put it in my mind, I\r\nwill nod my head to you, and on seeing me do this you must collect all\r\nthe armour that is in the house and hide it in the strong store room.\r\nMake some excuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing it; say\r\nthat you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as it\r\nis no longer what it was when Ulysses went away, but has become soiled\r\nand begrimed with soot. Add to this more particularly that you are\r\nafraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over their wine, and that they\r\nmay do each other some harm which may disgrace both banquet and wooing,\r\nfor the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use them. But leave\r\na sword and a spear apiece for yourself and me, and a couple of oxhide\r\nshields so that we can snatch them up at any moment; Jove and Minerva\r\nwill then soon quiet these people. There is also another matter; if you\r\nare indeed my son and my blood runs in your veins, let no one know that\r\nUlysses is within the house--neither Laertes, nor yet the swineherd, nor\r\nany of the servants, nor even Penelope herself.

As regards your question, however, I will\r\nnot prevaricate nor deceive you, but what the old man of the sea told\r\nme, so much will I tell you in full. He said he could see Ulysses on\r\nan island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph Calypso, who was\r\nkeeping him prisoner, and he could not reach his home, for he had no\r\nships nor sailors to take him over the sea.'

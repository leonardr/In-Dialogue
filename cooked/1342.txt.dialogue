{"1": [["\"Do you not want to know who has taken it?\""], ["\"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\""], ["\"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken\r\nby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\r\ndown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\r\ndelighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he\r\nis to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to\r\nbe in the house by the end of next week.\""], ["\"What is his name?\""], ["\"Bingley.\""], ["\"Is he married or single?\""], ["\"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or\r\nfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\""], ["\"How so? How can it affect them?\""], ["\"Is that his design in settling here?\""], ["\"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\r\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\r\nsoon as he comes.\""], ["\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send\r\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\r\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the\r\nparty.\""], ["\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\r\nI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\r\ngrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\""], ["\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\""], ["\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\r\nthe neighbourhood.\""], ["\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\""], ["\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\r\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to\r\ngo, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no\r\nnewcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to\r\nvisit him if you do not.\""], ["\"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\r\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\r\nhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though\r\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\""], ["\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\r\nothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\r\ngood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.\""], ["\"Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You\r\ntake delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.\""], ["\"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\r\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\r\nthese last twenty years at least.\""], ["\"Ah, you do not know what I suffer.\""], ["\"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\r\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\""], ["\"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not\r\nvisit them.\""], ["\"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\r\nall.\""], ["\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\""], ["\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces\r\nof her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\r\nof her.\""], ["\"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little\r\ncompassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\""], ["\"To-morrow fortnight.\""], ["\"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce\r\nMr. Bingley to _her_.\""], ["\"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\r\nmyself; how can you be so teasing?\""], ["\"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly\r\nvery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\r\nfortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,\r\nMrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as\r\nshe will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will\r\ntake it on myself.\""], ["\"Nonsense,\r\nnonsense!\""], ["\"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,\""], ["\"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If\r\nI had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called\r\non him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\r\ncannot escape the acquaintance now.\""], ["\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\r\npersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\r\nneglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a\r\ngood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a\r\nword about it till now.\""], ["\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\""], ["\"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\r\nparticularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this\r\nit would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\r\nanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to\r\nstand up with.\""], ["\"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\""], ["\"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one\r\nof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\r\ndare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\""], ["\"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively\r\nhandsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw\r\nanything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.\r\nHurst's gown--\""], ["\"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I\r\ndid not expect such a compliment.\""], ["\"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between\r\nus. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What\r\ncould be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help\r\nseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman\r\nin the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is\r\nvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a\r\nstupider person.\""], ["\"Dear Lizzy!\""], ["\"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.\r\nYou never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable\r\nin your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your\r\nlife.\""], ["\"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak\r\nwhat I think.\""], ["\"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_\r\ngood sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\r\nothers! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it\r\neverywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the\r\ngood of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing\r\nof the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters,\r\ntoo, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.\""], ["\"Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you\r\nconverse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep\r\nhis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\r\nneighbour in her.\""], ["\"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.\""], ["\"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be\r\nsure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he\r\n_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something\r\nabout Mr. Robinson.\""], ["\"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not\r\nI mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton\r\nassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many\r\npretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his\r\nanswering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,\r\nbeyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'\""], ["\"Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as\r\nif--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.\""], ["\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his\r\nill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite\r\na misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he\r\nsat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.\""], ["\"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\r\ncould not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at\r\nbeing spoke to.\""], ["\"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\r\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it\r\nwas; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had\r\nheard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to\r\nthe ball in a hack chaise.\""], ["\"I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.\""], ["\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can\r\nperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to\r\ndiscover it too.\""], ["\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.\""], ["\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal\r\nit, he must find it out.\""], ["\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane\r\nmeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they\r\nalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\r\nevery moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\r\ntherefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his\r\nattention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for\r\nfalling in love as much as she chooses.\""], ["\"Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might\r\nonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\r\nremember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four\r\nevenings may do a great deal.\""], ["\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they\r\nboth like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other\r\nleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\""], ["\"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not\r\nsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.\""], ["\"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\""], ["\"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see\r\nwhat he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by\r\nbeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.\""], ["\"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly\r\nwell just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at\r\nMeryton?\""], ["\"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady\r\nenergetic.\""], ["\"You are severe on us.\""], ["\"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There\r\nis nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first\r\nrefinements of polished society.\""], ["\"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\r\nthe less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.\""], ["\"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\""], ["\"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do\r\nyou often dance at St. James's?\""], ["\"Never, sir.\""], ["\"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?\""], ["\"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\""], ["\"You have a house in town, I conclude?\""], ["\"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond\r\nof superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of\r\nLondon would agree with Lady Lucas.\""], ["\"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow\r\nme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You\r\ncannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.\""], ["\"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you\r\nnot to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.\""], ["\"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny\r\nme the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the\r\namusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us\r\nfor one half-hour.\""], ["\"Mr. Darcy is all politeness,\""], ["\"He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,\r\nwe cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a\r\npartner?\""], ["\"I can guess the subject of your reverie.\""], ["\"I should imagine not.\""], ["\"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings\r\nin this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.\r\nI was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--the\r\nnothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would\r\nI give to hear your strictures on them!\""], ["\"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\r\nagreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure\r\nwhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\""], ["\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\""], ["\"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's\r\nimagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love\r\nto matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.\""], ["\"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is\r\nabsolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;\r\nand, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.\""], ["\"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two\r\nof the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but\r\nI am now convinced.\""], ["\"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.\""], ["\"Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\""], ["\"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I\r\nhad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must\r\nso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly\r\nfoolish.\""], ["\"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of\r\ntheir father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will\r\nnot think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when\r\nI liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my\r\nheart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,\r\nshould want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought\r\nColonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in\r\nhis regimentals.\""], ["\"Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,\r\nJane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\""], ["\"It is from Miss Bingley,\""], ["\"CAROLINE BINGLEY\""], ["\"Can I have the carriage?\""], ["\"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to\r\nrain; and then you must stay all night.\""], ["\"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton,\r\nand the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\""], ["\"I had much rather go in the coach.\""], ["\"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are\r\nwanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?\""], ["\"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\""], ["\"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\""], ["\"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\r\nimputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not\r\nhear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.\r\nJones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been\r\nto me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the\r\nmatter with me.--Yours, etc.\""], ["\"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling\r\ncolds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is\r\nall very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.\""], ["\"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.\""], ["\"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing\r\nwhen one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.\""], ["\"We will go as far as Meryton with you,\""], ["\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\r\nwalker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\r\nlooked almost wild.\""], ["\"She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\r\nnonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\r\ncountry, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!\""], ["\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\r\nin mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to\r\nhide it not doing its office.\""], ["\"Certainly not.\""], ["\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\r\nabove her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by\r\nit? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\r\na most country-town indifference to decorum.\""], ["\"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\""], ["\"I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very\r\nsweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with\r\nsuch a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is\r\nno chance of it.\""], ["\"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\r\nMeryton.\""], ["\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\""], ["\"That is capital,\""], ["\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\r\nconsideration in the world,\""], ["\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\r\ncredit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more\r\nthan I ever looked into.\""], ["\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying\r\nbooks.\""], ["\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\r\nthese.\""], ["\"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\r\nthat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\r\nhalf as delightful as Pemberley.\""], ["\"I wish it may.\""], ["\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\r\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\r\nfiner county in England than Derbyshire.\""], ["\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.\""], ["\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\""], ["\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\r\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.\""], ["\"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or\r\nrather taller.\""], ["\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\r\nso much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished\r\nfor her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.\""], ["\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?\""], ["\"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and\r\nnet purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure\r\nI never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being\r\ninformed that she was very accomplished.\""], ["\"Nor I, I am sure,\""], ["\"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\""], ["\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\r\nI rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.\""], ["\"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all\r\nthis?\""], ["\"I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and\r\napplication, and elegance, as you describe united.\""], ["\"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\""], ["\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\""], ["\"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.\""], ["\"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen\r\nthrough I am afraid is pitiful.\""], ["\"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate\r\ncharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\""], ["\"Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\r\nleast that advantage.\""], ["\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\r\nobserved in them for ever.\""], ["\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for\r\nmy part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\r\npleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?\""], ["\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting\r\nwith many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\r\nneighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.\""], ["\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\r\nWilliam is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So\r\ngenteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_\r\nis my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very\r\nimportant, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.\""], ["\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\""], ["\"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For\r\nmy part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;\r\n_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to\r\njudge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,\r\nI assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think\r\nCharlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.\""], ["\"She seems a very pleasant young woman.\""], ["\"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself\r\nhas often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast\r\nof my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody\r\nbetter looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own\r\npartiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother\r\nGardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was\r\nsure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he\r\ndid not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses\r\non her, and very pretty they were.\""], ["\"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,\""], ["\"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is\r\nstrong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\r\nam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\""], ["\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when\r\nyour sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of\r\nthe ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.\""], ["\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\""], ["\"You write uncommonly fast.\""], ["\"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.\""], ["\"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a\r\nyear! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!\""], ["\"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.\""], ["\"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.\""], ["\"I have already told her so once, by your desire.\""], ["\"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend\r\npens remarkably well.\""], ["\"Thank you--but I always mend my own.\""], ["\"How can you contrive to write so even?\""], ["\"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;\r\nand pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful\r\nlittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss\r\nGrantley's.\""], ["\"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At\r\npresent I have not room to do them justice.\""], ["\"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you\r\nalways write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\""], ["\"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me\r\nto determine.\""], ["\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with\r\nease, cannot write ill.\""], ["\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\""], ["\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which\r\nmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\""], ["\"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?\""], ["\"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\r\nwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of\r\nthought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you\r\nthink at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with\r\nquickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any\r\nattention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.\r\nBennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield\r\nyou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\r\npanegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very\r\nlaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\r\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?\""], ["\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that\r\nyou would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as\r\ndependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\r\nmounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better\r\nstay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not\r\ngo--and at another word, might stay a month.\""], ["\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions\r\nas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\""], ["\"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for\r\nhimself.\""], ["\"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,\r\nbut which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to\r\nstand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,\r\nthat the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and\r\nthe delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering\r\none argument in favour of its propriety.\""], ["\"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit\r\nwith you.\""], ["\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of\r\neither.\""], ["\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of\r\nfriendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\r\none readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\r\none into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\r\nsupposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\r\ncircumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\r\nthereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,\r\nwhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\r\nvery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\r\nwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?\""], ["\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to\r\narrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\r\nappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\r\nbetween the parties?\""], ["\"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss\r\nBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\r\nthankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\""], ["\"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\r\nopportunity of dancing a reel?\""], ["\"Indeed I do not dare.\""], ["\"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?\""], ["\"Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed\r\nin the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the\r\njudge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different\r\nlines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not have it taken, for\r\nwhat painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?\""], ["\"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their\r\ncolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be\r\ncopied.\""], ["\"I did not know that you intended to walk,\""], ["\"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the\r\navenue.\""], ["\"No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear\r\nto uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a\r\nfourth. Good-bye.\""], ["\"very glad;\""], ["\"How pleasant\r\nit is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no\r\nenjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\r\nbook! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not\r\nan excellent library.\""], ["\"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\r\nNetherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult\r\nthe wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are\r\nnot some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\r\npleasure.\""], ["\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be\r\nnear so much like a ball.\""], ["\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\r\nturn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so\r\nlong in one attitude.\""], ["\"What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\r\nmeaning?\""], ["\"But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has\r\nnot yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence of\r\nmind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will\r\nnot expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a\r\nsubject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.\""], ["\"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study\r\nof my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong\r\nunderstanding to ridicule.\""], ["\"Such as vanity and pride.\""], ["\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real\r\nsuperiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.\""], ["\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it\r\nhimself without disguise.\""], ["\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular\r\nevil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\""], ["\"And _your_ defect is to hate everybody.\""], ["\"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,\r\nunless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinners\r\nare good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.\""], ["\"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.\""], ["\"A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.\r\nBingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.\r\nBingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be\r\ngot to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this\r\nmoment.\""], ["\"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago\r\nI answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring\r\nearly attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,\r\nmay turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.\""], ["\"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of\r\nhim to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false\r\nfriends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did\r\nbefore him?\""], ["\"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that\r\nhead, as you will hear.\""], ["\"WILLIAM COLLINS\""], ["\"There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if\r\nhe is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to\r\ndiscourage him.\""], ["\"No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the\r\nreverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his\r\nletter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.\""], ["\"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may\r\nprove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so\r\noddly.\""], ["\"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\""], ["\"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\r\nmust confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things\r\nI know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates\r\nwill go when once they come to be entailed.\""], ["\"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and\r\ncould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing\r\nforward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come\r\nprepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,\r\nwhen we are better acquainted--\""], ["\"he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in\r\na person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself\r\nexperienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to\r\napprove of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of\r\npreaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,\r\nand had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\r\nquadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\r\npeople he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.\r\nShe had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\r\nmade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\r\nneighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or\r\ntwo, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to\r\nmarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\r\nonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly\r\napproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\r\nto suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.\""], ["\"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane\r\nfrom Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence.\""], ["\"I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?\""], ["\"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\r\nextensive property.\""], ["\"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says\r\nthat, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the\r\nhandsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks\r\nthe young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly\r\nconstitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many\r\naccomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am\r\ninformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\r\nresides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends\r\nto drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\""], ["\"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at\r\ncourt.\""], ["\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;\r\nand by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the\r\nBritish court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased\r\nwith the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\r\noffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable\r\nto ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that\r\nher charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most\r\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\r\nher. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and\r\nit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\r\npay.\""], ["\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I\r\nsometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\r\ncompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to\r\ngive them as unstudied an air as possible.\""], ["\"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away\r\nRichard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me\r\nso herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more\r\nabout it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.\""], ["\"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books\r\nof a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes\r\nme, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to\r\nthem as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.\""], ["\"As to\r\nher _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could\r\nnot positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her\r\n_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her\r\nto hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\""], ["\"stupid,\r\ndisagreeable fellows.\""], ["\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\r\nseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\r\nyesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\""], ["\"Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in\r\nthe neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\r\nHertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\r\nhim more favourably spoken of by anyone.\""], ["\"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\r\nill-tempered man.\""], ["\"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\r\nwas at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\r\nnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\""], ["\"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\r\nwishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\r\nand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\r\navoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense\r\nof very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he\r\nis. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\r\nthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never\r\nbe in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by\r\na thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\r\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\r\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\r\nmemory of his father.\""], ["\"Indeed!\""], ["\"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\r\nliving in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\r\nI cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\r\nand thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\r\nelsewhere.\""], ["\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\r\ngive me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\r\nintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\r\nconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\r\nto it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain\r\nit is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was\r\nof an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\r\nless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\r\nanything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and\r\nI may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can\r\nrecall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort\r\nof men, and that he hates me.\""], ["\"This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\""], ["\"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\r\ncan forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.\""], ["\"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\r\nattribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\r\nless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon\r\nattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had\r\nnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\r\nof preference which was often given me.\""], ["\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\r\nhim. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be\r\ndespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\r\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\r\nthis.\""], ["\"I _do_\r\nremember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of\r\nhis resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition\r\nmust be dreadful.\""], ["\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest\r\npart of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,\r\nsharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\r\nfather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,\r\nappears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of\r\nuse to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the\r\nPemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\r\nintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\r\nbe under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence,\r\nand when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\r\nvoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to\r\nbe as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.\""], ["\"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\""], ["\"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money\r\nfreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\r\npoor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what\r\nhis father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,\r\nto degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\r\nPemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\r\nwhich, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\r\ncareful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up\r\nas the most attentive and best of brothers.\""], ["\"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\""], ["\"I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to\r\nspeak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, very\r\nproud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\r\nof me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is\r\nnothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\r\nand, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, her\r\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\r\neducation.\""], ["\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,\r\nwho seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\r\nbe in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you\r\nknow Mr. Bingley?\""], ["\"Not at all.\""], ["\"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\r\nDarcy is.\""], ["\"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not\r\nwant abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\r\nhis while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is\r\na very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His\r\npride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\r\nsincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something\r\nfor fortune and figure.\""], ["\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\r\nwere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\""], ["\"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's\r\nconnections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\r\nyesterday.\""], ["\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\r\nbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\""], ["\"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on\r\nbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the\r\nbusiness? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of\r\nsomebody.\""], ["\"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my\r\nopinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light\r\nit places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such\r\na manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is\r\nimpossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his\r\ncharacter, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so\r\nexcessively deceived in him? Oh! no.\""], ["\"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than\r\nthat Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me\r\nlast night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it\r\nbe not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his\r\nlooks.\""], ["\"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to\r\nthink.\""], ["\"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\""], ["\"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if\r\nhe had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.\""], ["\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\""], ["\"Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find\r\na man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an\r\nevil.\""], ["\"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked\r\nabout the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size\r\nof the room, or the number of couples.\""], ["\"Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may\r\nobserve that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But\r\n_now_ we may be silent.\""], ["\"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\""], ["\"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\r\nentirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of\r\n_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the\r\ntrouble of saying as little as possible.\""], ["\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\r\nimagine that you are gratifying mine?\""], ["\"I must not decide on my own performance.\""], ["\"When you met us there the other day, we had just\r\nbeen forming a new acquaintance.\""], ["\"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners\r\nas may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of\r\n_retaining_ them, is less certain.\""], ["\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very\r\nsuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\r\nfirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\r\ndisgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\r\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at\r\nher sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then\r\nflow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You\r\nwill not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that\r\nyoung lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\""], ["\"Sir William's interruption has made\r\nme forget what we were talking of.\""], ["\"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\r\ninterrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.\r\nWe have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we\r\nare to talk of next I cannot imagine.\""], ["\"What think you of books?\""], ["\"Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\r\nfeelings.\""], ["\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\r\nno want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.\""], ["\"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\r\nsomething else.\""], ["\"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?\""], ["\"I am,\""], ["\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\""], ["\"I hope not.\""], ["\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\r\nto be secure of judging properly at first.\""], ["\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\""], ["\"And what is your success?\""], ["\"I do not get on at all. I hear such different\r\naccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\""], ["\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\r\nopportunity.\""], ["\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\""], ["\"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!\r\nYour sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand\r\nquestions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among\r\nhis other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late\r\nMr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to\r\ngive implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's\r\nusing him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has\r\nalways been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\r\nMr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but\r\nI know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he\r\ncannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother\r\nthought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to\r\nthe officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself\r\nout of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent\r\nthing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,\r\nMiss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really,\r\nconsidering his descent, one could not expect much better.\""], ["\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\""], ["\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\""], ["\"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\r\nsatisfied. But what does he say of the living?\""], ["\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\r\nthem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\r\nhim _conditionally_ only.\""], ["\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\""], ["\"Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\r\nI believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to\r\nassure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight.\""], ["\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\r\nsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\r\nnothing _he_ may not like to hear.\""], ["\"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you\r\nto offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\r\nso doing!\""], ["\"That will do\r\nextremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other\r\nyoung ladies have time to exhibit.\""], ["\"Lord,\r\nhow tired I am!\""], ["\"May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\r\nwhen I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\r\ncourse of this morning?\""], ["\"Oh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy\r\nwill be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I\r\nwant you up stairs.\""], ["\"Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse\r\nme. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am\r\ngoing away myself.\""], ["\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\r\ndoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You\r\nwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\r\nunwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected\r\nmother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the\r\npurport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\r\ndissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\r\nsoon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of\r\nmy future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\r\nsubject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for\r\nmarrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design\r\nof selecting a wife, as I certainly did.\""], ["\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\r\nevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\r\nof matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will\r\nadd very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought\r\nto have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\r\nrecommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\r\npatroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\r\ntoo!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\r\nleft Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\r\narranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you\r\nmust marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose\r\na gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,\r\nuseful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\r\nincome go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\r\nyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the\r\nway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice\r\nand kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\r\nadvantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\r\nanything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\r\nacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and\r\nrespect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\r\nintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\r\nwere directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\r\ncan assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\r\nbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\r\nfather (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\r\nmyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\r\nthe loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy\r\nevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not\r\nbe for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and\r\nI flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\r\nremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\r\nviolence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\r\nshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\r\naware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\r\nin the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's\r\ndecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\r\ntherefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that\r\nno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\""], ["\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You\r\nmust give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment\r\nof believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\r\nrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\r\nIn making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\r\nfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\r\nestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may\r\nbe considered, therefore, as finally settled.\""], ["\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\r\nshall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\r\nme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\r\nknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on\r\nthe first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to\r\nencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\r\nfemale character.\""], ["\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\r\nrefusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for\r\nbelieving it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is\r\nunworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would\r\nbe any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections\r\nwith the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\r\ncircumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further\r\nconsideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\r\nmeans certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your\r\nportion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo\r\nthe effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must\r\ntherefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,\r\nI shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\r\nsuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.\""], ["\"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\r\nof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\r\nrather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you\r\nagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\r\nto accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\r\nforbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\r\nfemale, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking\r\nthe truth from her heart.\""], ["\"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you\r\nare wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make\r\nLizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you\r\ndo not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.\""], ["\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,\r\nand Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\""], ["\"And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.\""], ["\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her\r\nmarrying him.\""], ["\"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\""], ["\"I have, sir.\""], ["\"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your\r\naccepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\""], ["\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\""], ["\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must\r\nbe a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you\r\nagain if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\r\nif you _do_.\""], ["\"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to\r\n_insist_ upon her marrying him.\""], ["\"I am glad you are come, for there is such\r\nfun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has\r\nmade an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.\""], ["\"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold\r\nyour tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation\r\ntogether.\""], ["\"Oh! Mr. Collins!\""], ["\"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good\r\ndeal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on\r\ntheir way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You\r\nshall hear what she says.\""], ["\"I do not pretend to regret anything\r\nI shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;\r\nbut we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that\r\ndelightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may\r\nlessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved\r\ncorrespondence. I depend on you for that.\""], ["\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\r\nHertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:\""], ["\"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\r\ntook him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we\r\nare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\r\nCharles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\r\ndetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\r\nhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are\r\nalready there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my\r\ndearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of\r\nthat I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may\r\nabound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your\r\nbeaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the\r\nthree of whom we shall deprive you.\""], ["\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.\""], ["\"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own\r\nmaster. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which\r\nparticularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.\""], ["\"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,\r\n_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think\r\nGeorgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;\r\nand the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into\r\nsomething still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of\r\nher being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before\r\nmentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the\r\ncountry without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\r\nunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have\r\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;\r\nher relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's\r\npartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\r\ncapable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to\r\nfavour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\r\nJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\r\nof so many?\""], ["\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?\""], ["\"Most willingly.\""], ["\"You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\r\nin love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him\r\nto town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\r\ndoes not care about you.\""], ["\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you\r\ntogether can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She\r\nis not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.\r\nDarcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the\r\ncase is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she\r\nis the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion\r\nthat when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble\r\nin achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and\r\nI dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,\r\nmy dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley\r\ntells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\r\ndegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\r\nTuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead\r\nof being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\""], ["\"That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\r\nwill not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.\r\nYou have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\""], ["\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\r\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\r\nelsewhere?\""], ["\"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider\r\nyour situation with much compassion.\""], ["\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\r\nrequired. A thousand things may arise in six months!\""], ["\"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my\r\ngood sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\r\noffending your patroness.\""], ["\"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her\r\ndispleasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\r\nagain, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\r\nand be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.\""], ["\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\r\naffectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive\r\nfrom me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your\r\nregard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though\r\nmy absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now\r\ntake the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my\r\ncousin Elizabeth.\""], ["\"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!\""], ["\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible\r\nthat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,\r\nbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\""], ["\"Undoubtedly;\""], ["\"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know\r\nthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\""], ["\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for\r\nbetter things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.\""], ["\"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was\r\nnot for the entail, I should not mind it.\""], ["\"What should not you mind?\""], ["\"I should not mind anything at all.\""], ["\"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\r\ninsensibility.\""], ["\"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How\r\nanyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own\r\ndaughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!\r\nWhy should _he_ have it more than anybody else?\""], ["\"I leave it to yourself to determine,\""], ["\"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no\r\nidea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But\r\nI will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall\r\nall be as we were before.\""], ["\"I have this comfort immediately,\r\nthat it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it\r\nhas done no harm to anyone but myself.\""], ["\"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will\r\nruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference\r\nof situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and\r\nCharlotte's steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a\r\nlarge family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be\r\nready to believe, for everybody's sake, that she may feel something like\r\nregard and esteem for our cousin.\""], ["\"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else\r\ncould be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that\r\nCharlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her\r\nunderstanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a\r\nconceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as\r\nI do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him\r\ncannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though\r\nit is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,\r\nchange the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade\r\nyourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of\r\ndanger security for happiness.\""], ["\"And men take care that they should.\""], ["\"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea\r\nof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.\""], ["\"And do you impute it to either of those?\""], ["\"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what\r\nI think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.\""], ["\"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?\""], ["\"Yes, in conjunction with his friend.\""], ["\"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can\r\nonly wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can\r\nsecure it.\""], ["\"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his\r\nhappiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they\r\nmay wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great\r\nconnections, and pride.\""], ["\"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not\r\nall expect Jane's good fortune.\""], ["\"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so\r\ndoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as\r\noften applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance,\r\nas to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley's\r\nlove?\""], ["\"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\r\ninattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time\r\nthey met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he\r\noffended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I\r\nspoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be\r\nfiner symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?\""], ["\"Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor\r\nJane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get\r\nover it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you\r\nwould have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she\r\nwould be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be\r\nof service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as\r\nanything.\""], ["\"And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his\r\nfriend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such\r\na part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may\r\nperhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he\r\nwould hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its\r\nimpurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley\r\nnever stirs without him.\""], ["\"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane\r\ncorrespond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.\""], ["\"She will drop the acquaintance entirely.\""], ["\"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because\r\nyou are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking\r\nopenly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve\r\nyourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want\r\nof fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against\r\n_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he\r\nought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you\r\nmust not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all\r\nexpect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and\r\ngood conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.\""], ["\"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\""], ["\"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\""], ["\"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of\r\nmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I\r\ncan prevent it.\""], ["\"Elizabeth, you are not serious now.\""], ["\"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with\r\nMr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,\r\nthe most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to\r\nme--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence\r\nof it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me does\r\nme the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My\r\nfather, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I\r\nshould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but\r\nsince we see every day that where there is affection, young people\r\nare seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into\r\nengagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many\r\nof my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it\r\nwould be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not\r\nto be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first\r\nobject. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,\r\nI will do my best.\""], ["\"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very\r\noften. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.\""], ["\"_wished_ they might be happy.\""], ["\"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\""], ["\"_That_ you certainly shall.\""], ["\"And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?\""], ["\"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\""], ["\"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to\r\ncome to Hunsford.\""], ["\"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her\r\nbetter judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been\r\nentirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister,\r\nthough the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I\r\nstill assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was\r\nas natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for\r\nwishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to\r\nhappen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not\r\nreturn my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I\r\nreceive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that\r\nshe had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not\r\ncalling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was\r\nin every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was\r\nperfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,\r\nthough I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out\r\nas she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on\r\nher side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting\r\nwrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the\r\ncause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know\r\nthis anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily\r\naccount for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to\r\nhis sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and\r\namiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,\r\nbecause, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.\r\nHe knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said\r\nherself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she\r\nwanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I\r\ncannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should\r\nbe almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity\r\nin all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,\r\nand think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the\r\ninvariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very\r\nsoon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield\r\nagain, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better\r\nnot mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts\r\nfrom our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and\r\nMaria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.\""], ["\"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that\r\nI have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure\r\nand elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and\r\nwish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial\r\ntowards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find\r\nout that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to\r\nthink her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My\r\nwatchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more\r\ninteresting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love\r\nwith him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.\r\nImportance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take\r\nhis defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the\r\nways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that\r\nhandsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.\""], ["\"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,\r\nbetween the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,\r\nand avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,\r\nbecause it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get\r\na girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is\r\nmercenary.\""], ["\"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know\r\nwhat to think.\""], ["\"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.\""], ["\"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's death\r\nmade her mistress of this fortune.\""], ["\"No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_\r\naffections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for\r\nmaking love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally\r\npoor?\""], ["\"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her\r\nso soon after this event.\""], ["\"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant\r\ndecorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,\r\nwhy should _we_?\""], ["\"_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being\r\ndeficient in something herself--sense or feeling.\""], ["\"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,\r\nto think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.\""], ["\"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in\r\nDerbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not\r\nmuch better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow\r\nwhere I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has\r\nneither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones\r\nworth knowing, after all.\""], ["\"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.\""], ["\"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine\r\nde Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\r\nbe delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I\r\ndoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice\r\nwhen service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she\r\nwill include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\r\nhonours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\r\ncharming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed\r\nto walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I\r\n_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.\""], ["\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of\r\nwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\""], ["\"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for\r\nthere is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make\r\nhaste, and come down this moment.\""], ["\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.\r\nWhy does she not come in?\""], ["\"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours\r\nwhen Miss de Bourgh comes in.\""], ["\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady\r\nCatherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which\r\nbecomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on\r\nwhatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion\r\nfor anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you\r\nfor being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank\r\npreserved.\""], ["\"A little.\""], ["\"Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\r\ninstrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it\r\nsome day. Do your sisters play and sing?\""], ["\"One of them does.\""], ["\"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss\r\nWebbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do\r\nyou draw?\""], ["\"No, not at all.\""], ["\"What, none of you?\""], ["\"Not one.\""], ["\"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother\r\nshould have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.\""], ["\"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.\""], ["\"Has your governess left you?\""], ["\"We never had any governess.\""], ["\"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home\r\nwithout a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must\r\nhave been quite a slave to your education.\""], ["\"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you\r\nmust have been neglected.\""], ["\"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as\r\nwished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to\r\nread, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be\r\nidle, certainly might.\""], ["\"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had\r\nknown your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage\r\none. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady\r\nand regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is\r\nwonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\r\nway. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces\r\nof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\r\nit was but the other day that I recommended another young person,\r\nwho was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\r\ndelighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's\r\ncalling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. 'Lady\r\nCatherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your\r\nyounger sisters out, Miss Bennet?\""], ["\"Yes, ma'am, all.\""], ["\"All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The\r\nyounger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters\r\nmust be very young?\""], ["\"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be\r\nmuch in company. But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon\r\nyounger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and\r\namusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to\r\nmarry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth\r\nat the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would\r\nnot be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\""], ["\"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not\r\nconceal your age.\""], ["\"I am not one-and-twenty.\""], ["\"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would\r\nnever have come so soon to wait upon me.\""], ["\"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never\r\nhappened to see her there?\""], ["\"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking\r\nof? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.\""], ["\"We are speaking of music, madam,\""], ["\"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I\r\nmust have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.\r\nThere are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment\r\nof music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,\r\nI should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health\r\nhad allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed\r\ndelightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\""], ["\"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write\r\nto her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often\r\ntell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without\r\nconstant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she\r\nwill never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.\r\nCollins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told\r\nher, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\r\nJenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part\r\nof the house.\""], ["\"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear\r\nme? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There\r\nis a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the\r\nwill of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate\r\nme.\""], ["\"Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of\r\nme, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky\r\nin meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part\r\nof the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of\r\ncredit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all\r\nthat you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to\r\nsay, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such\r\nthings may come out as will shock your relations to hear.\""], ["\"I am not afraid of you,\""], ["\"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.\r\nThe first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,\r\nwas at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced\r\nonly four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain\r\nknowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a\r\npartner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.\""], ["\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly\r\nbeyond my own party.\""], ["\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel\r\nFitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.\""], ["\"You are perfectly right. You have employed your\r\ntime much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can\r\nthink anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.\""], ["\"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and\r\ncould have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion\r\nof fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have\r\nbeen a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.\""], ["\"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!\r\nIt must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you\r\nall after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day\r\nbefore. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?\""], ["\"Perfectly so, I thank you.\""], ["\"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever\r\nreturning to Netherfield again?\""], ["\"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend\r\nvery little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and\r\nis at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually\r\nincreasing.\""], ["\"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for\r\nthe neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we\r\nmight possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did\r\nnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as\r\nfor his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same\r\nprinciple.\""], ["\"This seems a very comfortable\r\nhouse. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.\r\nCollins first came to Hunsford.\""], ["\"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\r\nkindness on a more grateful object.\""], ["\"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.\""], ["\"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one\r\nof the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made\r\nhim happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though\r\nI am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the\r\nwisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a\r\nprudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.\""], ["\"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a\r\ndistance of her own family and friends.\""], ["\"An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.\""], ["\"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's\r\njourney. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.\""], ["\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond\r\nthe very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.\""], ["\"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her\r\nfamily. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many\r\nvarying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of\r\ntravelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the\r\ncase _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not\r\nsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my\r\nfriend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_\r\nthe present distance.\""], ["\"_You_ cannot\r\nhave a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have\r\nbeen always at Longbourn.\""], ["\"Are you pleased with Kent?\""], ["\"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.\""], ["\"No, I should have turned in a moment.\""], ["\"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\""], ["\"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He\r\narranges the business just as he pleases.\""], ["\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\r\npleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems\r\nmore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.\""], ["\"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of\r\neither. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and\r\ndependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\r\nwherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?\""], ["\"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\r\nexperienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater\r\nweight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where\r\nthey like.\""], ["\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often\r\ndo.\""], ["\"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many\r\nin my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to\r\nmoney.\""], ["\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\r\nhaving someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a\r\nlasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well\r\nfor the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\r\nlikes with her.\""], ["\"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your\r\ncharge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a\r\nlittle difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she\r\nmay like to have her own way.\""], ["\"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare\r\nsay she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a\r\nvery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and\r\nMiss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.\""], ["\"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he\r\nis a great friend of Darcy's.\""], ["\"Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\r\nthose points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in\r\nour journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to\r\nhim. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that\r\nBingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.\""], ["\"What is it you mean?\""], ["\"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,\r\nbecause if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an\r\nunpleasant thing.\""], ["\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\""], ["\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\r\nBingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself\r\non having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\r\nimprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\r\nparticulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing\r\nhim the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\r\nknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.\""], ["\"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\""], ["\"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the\r\nlady.\""], ["\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\""], ["\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\""], ["\"There were some very strong objections against the lady,\""], ["\"In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be\r\nrepressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love\r\nyou.\""], ["\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\r\nexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\r\nunequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should\r\nbe felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\r\ncannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\r\nbestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to\r\nanyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be\r\nof short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented\r\nthe acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in\r\novercoming it after this explanation.\""], ["\"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!\r\nI might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\r\ncivility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.\""], ["\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\r\nexcuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\r\nyou cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means\r\nof dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the\r\nworld for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for\r\ndisappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\r\nkind.\""], ["\"Can you deny that you have done it?\""], ["\"I have no wish of denying\r\nthat I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\r\nsister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\r\nkinder than towards myself.\""], ["\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,\""], ["\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an\r\ninterest in him?\""], ["\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\r\ndeclaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern\r\nwhich I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more\r\ngentlemanlike manner.\""], ["\"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that\r\nwould have tempted me to accept it.\""], ["\"From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of\r\nmy acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest\r\nbelief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of\r\nthe feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of\r\ndisapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a\r\ndislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\r\nlast man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\""], ["\"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\r\nfeelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\r\nForgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\r\nwishes for your health and happiness.\""], ["\"I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.\r\nWill you do me the honour of reading that letter?\""], ["\"FITZWILLIAM DARCY\""], ["\"This must be false!\r\nThis cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!\""], ["\"What would she have said? how\r\nwould she have behaved?\""], ["\"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that\r\nyou may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your\r\ncompany, I am sure.\""], ["\"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected\r\nyou to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There\r\ncan be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly\r\nspare you for another fortnight.\""], ["\"But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.\""], ["\"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters\r\nare never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay\r\nanother _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as\r\nfar as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as\r\nDawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room\r\nfor one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I\r\nshould not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.\""], ["\"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our\r\noriginal plan.\""], ["\"Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant\r\nwith them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea\r\nof two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.\r\nYou must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in\r\nthe world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly\r\nguarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my\r\nniece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her\r\nhaving two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of\r\nMr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with\r\npropriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those\r\nthings. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I\r\nam glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be\r\ndiscreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.\""], ["\"My uncle is to send a servant for us.\""], ["\"Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you\r\nhave somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?\r\nOh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be\r\nattended to.\""], ["\"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not\r\ndisagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately\r\nhaving it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,\r\nfrom our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the\r\nhumble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford\r\nvisit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to\r\nLady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage\r\nand blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You\r\nsee how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge\r\nthat, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should\r\nnot think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are\r\nsharers of our intimacy at Rosings.\""], ["\"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into\r\nHertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will\r\nbe able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you\r\nhave been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear\r\nthat your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be\r\nas well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,\r\nthat I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in\r\nmarriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of\r\nthinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of\r\ncharacter and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each\r\nother.\""], ["\"A great many indeed,\""], ["\"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!\r\nHow much I shall have to tell!\""], ["\"And how much I shall have to conceal!\""], ["\"Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?\""], ["\"Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and\r\nwhen I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I\r\nthink it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what\r\none wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they\r\nare going in a fortnight.\""], ["\"Are they indeed!\""], ["\"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to\r\ntake us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme;\r\nand I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to\r\ngo too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall\r\nhave!\""], ["\"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the\r\nwaiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse\r\nthings said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad\r\nhe is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for\r\nmy news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?\r\nThere is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! She\r\nis gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.\""], ["\"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\""], ["\"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\""], ["\"I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared\r\nthree straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled\r\nthing?\""], ["\"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\""], ["\"Far be it from me, my dear sister,\r\nto depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the\r\ngenerality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for\r\n_me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.\""], ["\"Blame you! Oh, no.\""], ["\"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?\""], ["\"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.\""], ["\"But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next\r\nday.\""], ["\"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so\r\nfull of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am\r\ngrowing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion\r\nmakes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will\r\nbe as light as a feather.\""], ["\"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\r\ncountenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!\""], ["\"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those\r\ntwo young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the\r\nappearance of it.\""], ["\"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you\r\nused to do.\""], ["\"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike\r\nto him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an\r\nopening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually\r\nabusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing\r\nat a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.\""], ["\"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat\r\nthe matter as you do now.\""], ["\"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And\r\nwith no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say\r\nthat I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I\r\nhad! Oh! how I wanted you!\""], ["\"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions\r\nin speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly\r\nundeserved.\""], ["\"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most\r\nnatural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There\r\nis one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I\r\nought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand\r\nWickham's character.\""], ["\"Surely there can be no\r\noccasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?\""], ["\"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me\r\nto make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular\r\nrelative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to\r\nmyself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his\r\nconduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy\r\nis so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in\r\nMeryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal\r\nto it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to\r\nanyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,\r\nand then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At\r\npresent I will say nothing about it.\""], ["\"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for\r\never. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to\r\nre-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.\""], ["\"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\""], ["\"Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I\r\nshall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I\r\nwould not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will\r\ndie of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.\""], ["\"No, nothing at all.\""], ["\"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _they_ will\r\ntake care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed\r\nfor money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often\r\ntalk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as\r\nquite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.\""], ["\"It was a subject which they could not mention before me.\""], ["\"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they\r\noften talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an\r\nestate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be\r\nashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.\""], ["\"I am sure I shall break _mine_,\""], ["\"If one could but go to Brighton!\""], ["\"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so\r\ndisagreeable.\""], ["\"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\""], ["\"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,\""], ["\"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public\r\nplace or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so\r\nlittle expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present\r\ncircumstances.\""], ["\"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not\r\nof particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our\r\nimportance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the\r\nwild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark\r\nLydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear\r\nfather, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and\r\nof teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of\r\nher life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character\r\nwill be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\r\nthat ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the\r\nworst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond\r\nyouth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness\r\nof her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal\r\ncontempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger\r\nKitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,\r\nignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you\r\nsuppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\r\nthey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the\r\ndisgrace?\""], ["\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known\r\nyou must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less\r\nadvantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly\r\nsisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to\r\nBrighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will\r\nkeep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an\r\nobject of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance\r\neven as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find\r\nwomen better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being\r\nthere may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow\r\nmany degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest\r\nof her life.\""], ["\"How long did you say he was at Rosings?\""], ["\"Nearly three weeks.\""], ["\"And you saw him frequently?\""], ["\"Yes, almost every day.\""], ["\"His manners are very different from his cousin's.\""], ["\"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.\""], ["\"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that\r\nhis mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from\r\nknowing him better, his disposition was better understood.\""], ["\"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily\r\ncomprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume\r\neven the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,\r\nmay be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only\r\ndeter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only\r\nfear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been\r\nalluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good\r\nopinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always\r\noperated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be\r\nimputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I\r\nam certain he has very much at heart.\""], ["\"But we expect him to-morrow, with\r\na large party of friends.\""], ["\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\""], ["\"A little.\""], ["\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?\""], ["\"Yes, very handsome.\""], ["\"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you\r\nwill see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late\r\nmaster's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to\r\nbe then. He was very fond of them.\""], ["\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\""], ["\"Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\r\naccomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is\r\na new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she\r\ncomes here to-morrow with him.\""], ["\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\""], ["\"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his\r\ntime here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.\""], ["\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\""], ["\"Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is\r\ngood enough for him.\""], ["\"It is\r\nvery much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.\""], ["\"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in\r\nhaving such a master.\""], ["\"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could\r\nnot meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are\r\ngood-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and\r\nhe was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the\r\nworld.\""], ["\"Can this be Mr. Darcy?\""], ["\"His father was an excellent man,\""], ["\"Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\r\nas affable to the poor.\""], ["\"In what an amiable light does this place him!\""], ["\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\""], ["\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\""], ["\"He is certainly a good brother,\""], ["\"Why is he so altered? From what can\r\nit proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his\r\nmanners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a\r\nchange as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.\""], ["\"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,\""], ["\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more\r\nthan civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\r\nattention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.\""], ["\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?\r\nThey must be a great loss to _your_ family.\""], ["\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\r\nwere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\r\nyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_\r\na beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she\r\nseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\r\none time.\""], ["\"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a\r\nmost unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be\r\nassured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.\r\nAn express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,\r\nfrom Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland\r\nwith one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our\r\nsurprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am\r\nvery, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing\r\nto hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.\r\nThoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step\r\n(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is\r\ndisinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.\r\nOur poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How\r\nthankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against\r\nhim; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about\r\ntwelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\r\neight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have\r\npassed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect\r\nhim here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of\r\ntheir intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor\r\nmother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly\r\nknow what I have written.\""], ["\"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I\r\nwish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my\r\nhead is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest\r\nLizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,\r\nand it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham\r\nand our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has\r\ntaken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\r\nto Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the\r\nday before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short\r\nletter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna\r\nGreen, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.\r\nnever intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was\r\nrepeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.\r\nintending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,\r\nbut no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney\r\ncoach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that\r\nis known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.\r\nI know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that\r\nside London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing\r\nthem at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but\r\nwithout any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With\r\nthe kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions\r\nto us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved\r\nfor him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our\r\ndistress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the\r\nworst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make\r\nit more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue\r\ntheir first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a\r\nyoung woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose\r\nher so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that\r\nColonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his\r\nhead when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to\r\nbe trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she\r\nexert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And\r\nas to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has\r\nanger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of\r\nconfidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you\r\nhave been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the\r\nfirst shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not\r\nso selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I\r\ntake up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but\r\ncircumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to\r\ncome here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,\r\nthat I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something\r\nmore to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel\r\nForster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure\r\nI know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any\r\nmeasure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to\r\nbe at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my\r\nuncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will\r\nimmediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\""], ["\"Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you\r\npresent relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.\""], ["\"I have just had a letter from Jane,\r\nwith such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger\r\nsister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into\r\nthe power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.\r\n_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no\r\nconnections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.\""], ["\"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced\r\nalmost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to\r\nScotland.\""], ["\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?\""], ["\"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's\r\nimmediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But\r\nnothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is\r\nsuch a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have\r\nnot the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!\""], ["\"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known what\r\nI ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too\r\nmuch. Wretched, wretched mistake!\""], ["\"I am afraid you have been\r\nlong desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my\r\nstay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything\r\ncould be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to\r\nsuch distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may\r\nseem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I\r\nfear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley\r\nto-day.\""], ["\"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that\r\nurgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as\r\nlong as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.\""], ["\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\r\n_That_ is all settled.\""], ["\"Do you really think so?\""], ["\"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\r\nneglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I\r\ndare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been\r\nthe case?\""], ["\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such\r\na presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\r\nBarnet road.\""], ["\"Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though\r\nfor the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is\r\nnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\r\nmight strike them that they could be more economically, though less\r\nexpeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.\""], ["\"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\r\nmarriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular\r\nfriend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending\r\nto marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\r\ncannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she\r\nbeyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,\r\nforego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\r\nrestraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\r\ndishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\r\nnothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\r\nother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has\r\nno brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's\r\nbehaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\r\nseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\r\ndo as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\r\nsuch a matter.\""], ["\"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him\r\nas to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?\""], ["\"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be\r\ntheir former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,\r\ntill it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what\r\nWickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every\r\nsense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is\r\nas false and deceitful as he is insinuating.\""], ["\"And do you really know all this?\""], ["\"But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you\r\nand Jane seem so well to understand?\""], ["\"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw\r\nso much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\r\nignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire\r\nwas to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the\r\ncase, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\r\nnecessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could\r\nit apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the\r\nneighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was\r\nsettled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening\r\nher eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be\r\nin any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a\r\nconsequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far\r\nenough from my thoughts.\""], ["\"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I\r\nsuppose, to believe them fond of each other?\""], ["\"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either\r\nside; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\r\nthat ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first\r\nhe entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all\r\nwere. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for\r\nthe first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular\r\nattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and\r\nwild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,\r\nwho treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.\""], ["\"Is my father in town?\""], ["\"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.\""], ["\"And have you heard from him often?\""], ["\"We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say\r\nthat he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\r\nparticularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write\r\nagain till he had something of importance to mention.\""], ["\"And my mother--how is she? How are you all?\""], ["\"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly\r\nshaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you\r\nall. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank\r\nHeaven, are quite well.\""], ["\"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.\r\nBut we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of\r\neach other the balm of sisterly consolation.\""], ["\"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful\r\nlesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one\r\nfalse step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less\r\nbrittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in\r\nher behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.\""], ["\"But tell me all and everything about it which\r\nI have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel\r\nForster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement\r\ntook place? They must have seen them together for ever.\""], ["\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,\r\nespecially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so\r\ngrieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He\r\n_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had\r\nany idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension\r\nfirst got abroad, it hastened his journey.\""], ["\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of\r\ntheir intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?\""], ["\"Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of\r\ntheir plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not\r\nrepeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am\r\ninclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.\""], ["\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a\r\ndoubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\""], ["\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt\r\na little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him\r\nin marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\r\nright. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how\r\nimprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural\r\ntriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter\r\nshe had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their\r\nbeing in love with each other, many weeks.\""], ["\"But not before they went to Brighton?\""], ["\"No, I believe not.\""], ["\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does\r\nhe know his real character?\""], ["\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly\r\ndid. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad\r\naffair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;\r\nbut I hope this may be false.\""], ["\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,\r\nthis could not have happened!\""], ["\"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his\r\nwife?\""], ["\"He brought it with him for us to see.\""], ["\"LYDIA BENNET.\""], ["\"I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten\r\nminutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in\r\nsuch confusion!\""], ["\"I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is\r\nvery difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to\r\ngive her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so\r\nmuch as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen\r\nalmost took from me my faculties.\""], ["\"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look\r\nwell. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety\r\nupon yourself alone.\""], ["\"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every\r\nfatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.\r\nKitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours\r\nof repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn\r\non Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till\r\nThursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And\r\nLady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to\r\ncondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters', if\r\nthey should be of use to us.\""], ["\"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\r\npossible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,\r\nwhether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to\r\nknow in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were\r\nanyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a\r\nclue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have\r\nnothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in\r\nhis power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps,\r\nLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any\r\nother person.\""], ["\"I am, dear sir, etc., etc.\""], ["\"Say\r\nnothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,\r\nand I ought to feel it.\""], ["\"You must not be too severe upon yourself,\""], ["\"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone\r\nto fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have\r\nbeen to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.\r\nIt will pass away soon enough.\""], ["\"Do you suppose them to be in London?\""], ["\"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?\""], ["\"And Lydia used to want to go to London,\""], ["\"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me\r\nlast May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.\""], ["\"_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne\r\nfor fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and\r\nyou will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into\r\nmy house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be\r\nabsolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.\r\nAnd you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have\r\nspent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.\""], ["\"I beg your pardon,\r\nmadam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some\r\ngood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.\""], ["\"What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.\""], ["\"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the\r\nlittle copse.\""], ["\"Oh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from my uncle?\""], ["\"Yes I have had a letter from him by express.\""], ["\"Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?\""], ["\"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,\r\nupon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you\r\nleft me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of\r\nLondon they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough\r\nto know they are discovered. I have seen them both--\""], ["\"EDW. GARDINER.\""], ["\"And have you answered the letter?\""], ["\"No; but it must be done soon.\""], ["\"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\""], ["\"And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!\""], ["\"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there\r\nare two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money\r\nyour uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever\r\nto pay him.\""], ["\"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a\r\ntemptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am\r\ngone.\""], ["\"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be\r\nrepaid?\""], ["\"Just as you please.\""], ["\"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?\""], ["\"Take whatever you like, and get away.\""], ["\"Mrs.\r\nBennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and\r\ndaughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this\r\nneighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the\r\nimpudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.\""], ["\"It was greatly my wish that he should do so,\""], ["\"E. GARDINER.\""], ["\"Oh! mamma, do the\r\npeople hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;\r\nand we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he\r\nshould know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took\r\noff my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that\r\nhe might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.\""], ["\"Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go\r\nlower, because I am a married woman.\""], ["\"Mrs. Wickham\""], ["\"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't\r\nat all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?\""], ["\"Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all\r\nthings. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We\r\nshall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some\r\nballs, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.\""], ["\"I should like it beyond anything!\""], ["\"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters\r\nbehind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the\r\nwinter is over.\""], ["\"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You\r\nwere not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you\r\ncurious to hear how it was managed?\""], ["\"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were\r\nmarried, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in\r\nthat parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\r\no'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\r\nwere to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in\r\nsuch a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to\r\nput it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was\r\nmy aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as\r\nif she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in\r\nten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed\r\nto know whether he would be married in his blue coat.\""], ["\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never\r\nbe over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt\r\nwere horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe\r\nme, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\r\nfortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was\r\nrather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so\r\njust as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon\r\nbusiness to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once\r\nthey get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I\r\ndid not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we\r\nwere beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he\r\ncame back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However,\r\nI recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the\r\nwedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\""], ["\"Mr. Darcy!\""], ["\"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious\r\nme! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised\r\nthem so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!\""], ["\"M. GARDINER.\""], ["\"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\""], ["\"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and\r\nnow we are better.\""], ["\"True. Are the others coming out?\""], ["\"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to\r\nMeryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that\r\nyou have actually seen Pemberley.\""], ["\"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much\r\nfor me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the\r\nold housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of\r\nme. But of course she did not mention my name to you.\""], ["\"Yes, she did.\""], ["\"And what did she say?\""], ["\"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned\r\nout well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely\r\nmisrepresented.\""], ["\"Certainly,\""], ["\"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other\r\nseveral times. I wonder what he can be doing there.\""], ["\"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I\r\nunderstood from the Gardiners that you had.\""], ["\"Yes; he introduced us to his sister.\""], ["\"And do you like her?\""], ["\"Very much.\""], ["\"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year\r\nor two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad\r\nyou liked her. I hope she will turn out well.\""], ["\"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\""], ["\"Did you go by the village of Kympton?\""], ["\"I do not recollect that we did.\""], ["\"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A\r\nmost delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited\r\nme in every respect.\""], ["\"How should you have liked making sermons?\""], ["\"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,\r\nand the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to\r\nrepine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The\r\nquiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas\r\nof happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the\r\ncircumstance, when you were in Kent?\""], ["\"I have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was\r\nleft you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.\""], ["\"You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the\r\nfirst, you may remember.\""], ["\"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not\r\nso palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually\r\ndeclared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business\r\nhad been compromised accordingly.\""], ["\"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember\r\nwhat I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.\""], ["\"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let\r\nus quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one\r\nmind.\""], ["\"Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.\""], ["\"Write to me very often, my dear.\""], ["\"As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for\r\nwriting. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to\r\ndo.\""], ["\"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,\r\nbut only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If\r\nthat had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.\""], ["\"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\r\nreport; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from\r\nany silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that\r\nI _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect\r\nme either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes\r\nalone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of\r\n_myself_, but I dread other people's remarks.\""], ["\"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I\r\nwent to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in\r\nnothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again.\""], ["\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait\r\non him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I\r\nam determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will\r\nmake thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for\r\nhim.\""], ["\"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\r\nknow.\""], ["\"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of\r\nMr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must\r\nsay that I hate the very sight of him.\""], ["\"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\""], ["\"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say\r\nyou meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\r\nit is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,\r\nsince you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my\r\nown daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\r\nseen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;\r\nthough it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately,\r\nGeorge Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a\r\nsyllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.\r\nIt was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to\r\nmake such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\""], ["\"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when\r\nhe was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If\r\nhe no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will\r\nthink no more about him.\""], ["\"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?\""], ["\"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with\r\nyou as ever.\""], ["\"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\r\ndo we?\""], ["\"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\r\nexpect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not\r\nprotest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\r\nThere is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!\""], ["\"Is your sister at Pemberley still?\""], ["\"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.\""], ["\"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?\""], ["\"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,\r\nthese three weeks.\""], ["\"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.\r\nI assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\r\nagreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am\r\nperfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had\r\nany design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed\r\nwith greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally\r\npleasing, than any other man.\""], ["\"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!\""], ["\"And how impossible in others!\""], ["\"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\r\nacknowledge?\""], ["\"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to\r\ninstruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive\r\nme; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.\""], ["\"Can you come to-morrow?\""], ["\"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is\r\ncome. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss\r\nBennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss\r\nLizzy's hair.\""], ["\"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!\r\nWhere is your sash, my dear?\""], ["\"What is the matter mamma? What do\r\nyou keep winking at me for? What am I to do?\""], ["\"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\""], ["\"Where is your sister?\""], ["\"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.\""], ["\"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.\""], ["\"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be\r\nunpardonable in me.\""], ["\"It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to\r\nhis acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\r\nchosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\r\nas I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\r\nlearn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we\r\ncan never be what we once were to each other.\""], ["\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,\r\nhe really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being\r\nindifferent would have prevented his coming down again!\""], ["\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\r\nmodesty.\""], ["\"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as\r\nyou. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your\r\nhappiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very\r\ngood luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.\""], ["\"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\r\nmother.\""], ["\"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.\""], ["\"You have a very small park here,\""], ["\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I\r\nassure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's.\""], ["\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in\r\nsummer; the windows are full west.\""], ["\"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and\r\nMrs. Collins well.\""], ["\"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.\""], ["\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\r\non one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\r\nwill favour me with your company.\""], ["\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\""], ["\"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\r\njourney hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I\r\ncome.\""], ["\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account\r\nfor the honour of seeing you here.\""], ["\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.\""], ["\"If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\r\nindustriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a\r\nreport is spread abroad?\""], ["\"I never heard that it was.\""], ["\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?\""], ["\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may\r\nask questions which I shall not choose to answer.\""], ["\"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has\r\nhe, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?\""], ["\"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\""], ["\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\r\nreason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,\r\nhave made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You\r\nmay have drawn him in.\""], ["\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\""], ["\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such\r\nlanguage as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\r\nand am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.\""], ["\"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,\r\never induce me to be explicit.\""], ["\"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\r\npresumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is\r\nengaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?\""], ["\"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will\r\nmake an offer to me.\""], ["\"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,\r\nthey have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of\r\n_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned\r\nthe union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would\r\nbe accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of\r\ninferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\r\nthe family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his\r\ntacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\r\npropriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest\r\nhours he was destined for his cousin?\""], ["\"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is\r\nno other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not\r\nbe kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to\r\nmarry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the\r\nmarriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither\r\nby honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make\r\nanother choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\""], ["\"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,\r\nMiss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or\r\nfriends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will\r\nbe censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.\r\nYour alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned\r\nby any of us.\""], ["\"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude\r\nfor my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that\r\nscore? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came\r\nhere with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will\r\nI be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's\r\nwhims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\""], ["\"_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;\r\nbut it will have no effect on me.\""], ["\"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my\r\nnephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal\r\nside, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,\r\nhonourable, and ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on\r\nboth sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of\r\nevery member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?\r\nThe upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,\r\nor fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you\r\nwere sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in\r\nwhich you have been brought up.\""], ["\"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that\r\nsphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are\r\nequal.\""], ["\"True. You _are_ a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother?\r\nWho are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their\r\ncondition.\""], ["\"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\""], ["\"I am not.\""], ["\"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?\""], ["\"I will make no promise of the kind.\""], ["\"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more\r\nreasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that\r\nI will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the\r\nassurance I require.\""], ["\"And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into\r\nanything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry\r\nyour daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their\r\nmarriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would\r\nmy refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?\r\nAllow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have\r\nsupported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the\r\napplication was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if\r\nyou think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your\r\nnephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;\r\nbut you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,\r\ntherefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.\""], ["\"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the\r\nobjections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am\r\nno stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous\r\nelopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was a\r\npatched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is\r\nsuch a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his\r\nlate father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are\r\nyou thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?\""], ["\"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!\r\nUnfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you\r\nmust disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?\""], ["\"Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.\""], ["\"You are then resolved to have him?\""], ["\"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,\r\nwhich will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without\r\nreference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.\""], ["\"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the\r\nclaims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in\r\nthe opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.\""], ["\"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.\r\nI shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your\r\nambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you\r\nreasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.\""], ["\"I take no leave\r\nof you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve\r\nno such attention. I am most seriously displeased.\""], ["\"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously\r\ncivil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were\r\nwell. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through\r\nMeryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had\r\nnothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?\""], ["\"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\r\nexceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its\r\ncontents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink\r\nof matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.\""], ["\"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters\r\nas these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the\r\nname of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.\""], ["\"From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?\""], ["\"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\""], ["\"_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_\r\nsurprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within\r\nthe circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie\r\nmore effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any\r\nwoman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his\r\nlife! It is admirable!\""], ["\"Are you not diverted?\""], ["\"Oh! yes. Pray read on.\""], ["\"'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last\r\nnight, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she\r\nfelt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some\r\nfamily objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her\r\nconsent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty\r\nto give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and\r\nher noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\r\nhastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.' Mr.\r\nCollins moreover adds, 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad\r\nbusiness has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their\r\nliving together before the marriage took place should be so generally\r\nknown. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain\r\nfrom declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young\r\ncouple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an\r\nencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should\r\nvery strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them,\r\nas a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their\r\nnames to be mentioned in your hearing.' That is his notion of Christian\r\nforgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's\r\nsituation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you\r\nlook as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _missish_,\r\nI hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we\r\nlive, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our\r\nturn?\""], ["\"Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man\r\nit would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_\r\npointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate\r\nwriting, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any\r\nconsideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving\r\nhim the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\r\nhypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine\r\nabout this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?\""], ["\"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving\r\nrelief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I\r\ncan no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my\r\npoor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to\r\nacknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest\r\nof my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\""], ["\"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to\r\nme that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could\r\nnot rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,\r\nin the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced\r\nyou to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the\r\nsake of discovering them.\""], ["\"You are too generous to trifle with me. If your\r\nfeelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_\r\naffections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence\r\nme on this subject for ever.\""], ["\"Yes, you know enough\r\nof my frankness to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so\r\nabominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all\r\nyour relations.\""], ["\"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your\r\naccusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my\r\nbehaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was\r\nunpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.\""], ["\"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I\r\nthen said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of\r\nit, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your\r\nreproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a\r\nmore gentlemanlike manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you can\r\nscarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time,\r\nI confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.\""], ["\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an\r\nimpression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such\r\na way.\""], ["\"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper\r\nfeeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never\r\nforget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible\r\nway that would induce you to accept me.\""], ["\"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at\r\nall. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.\""], ["\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the\r\npreservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my\r\nopinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily\r\nchanged as that implies.\""], ["\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The\r\nadieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings\r\nof the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now\r\nso widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant\r\ncircumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some\r\nof my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you\r\npleasure.\""], ["\"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your\r\nretrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment\r\narising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of\r\ninnocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude\r\nwhich cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish\r\nbeing all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I\r\nwas taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I\r\nwas given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.\r\nUnfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt\r\nby my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all\r\nthat was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught\r\nme to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family\r\ncircle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least\r\nto think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I\r\nwas, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been\r\nbut for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You\r\ntaught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you,\r\nI was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.\r\nYou showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman\r\nworthy of being pleased.\""], ["\"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?\""], ["\"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be\r\nwishing, expecting my addresses.\""], ["\"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure\r\nyou. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me\r\nwrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?\""], ["\"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take\r\na proper direction.\""], ["\"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at\r\nPemberley. You blamed me for coming?\""], ["\"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\""], ["\"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.\r\nMy conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I\r\nconfess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.\""], ["\"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\""], ["\"I must ask whether you were surprised?\""], ["\"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.\""], ["\"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.\""], ["\"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits\r\nwhich I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.\""], ["\"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to\r\nhim.\""], ["\"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had\r\nprevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but\r\nhis reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess\r\none thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not\r\nallow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\r\nlast winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was\r\nangry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained\r\nin any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me\r\nnow.\""], ["\"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\""], ["\"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,\r\nyou shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.\""], ["\"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and\r\nI am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am\r\nin earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are\r\nengaged.\""], ["\"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much\r\nyou dislike him.\""], ["\"You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I\r\ndid not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as\r\nthese, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever\r\nremember it myself.\""], ["\"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that\r\nwe are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,\r\nJane? Shall you like to have such a brother?\""], ["\"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more\r\ndelight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you\r\nreally love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than\r\nmarry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought\r\nto do?\""], ["\"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I\r\ntell you all.\""], ["\"What do you mean?\""], ["\"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley.

So, do not put yourself to\r\ninconvenience.\""], ["\"Go to your father, he\r\nwants you in the library.\""], ["\"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him.

And so, Darcy did every thing;\r\nmade up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him\r\nhis commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble\r\nand economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have\r\npaid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own\r\nway. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about\r\nhis love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.\""], ["\"If any young men come\r\nfor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.\""], ["\"Good gracious!

It was very little less.\r\nThe fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious\r\nattention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,\r\nand looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and\r\ninterested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really\r\namiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you\r\ntook to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and\r\nin your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously\r\ncourted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for\r\nit; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly\r\nreasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks\r\nof _that_ when they fall in love.\""], ["\"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was\r\nill at Netherfield?\""], ["\"Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her?

My good qualities are under your protection, and you are\r\nto exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me\r\nto find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may\r\nbe; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling\r\nto come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first\r\ncalled, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did\r\nyou look as if you did not care about me?\""], ["\"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.\""], ["\"But I was embarrassed.\""], ["\"And so was I.\""], ["\"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\""], ["\"A man who had felt less, might.\""], ["\"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that\r\nI should be so reasonable as to admit it!

My resolution of\r\nthanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.\r\n_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort\r\nsprings from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the\r\nsubject. This will never do.\""], ["\"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady\r\nCatherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of\r\nremoving all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to\r\nyour eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour\r\nto wait for any opening of yours. My aunt's intelligence had given me\r\nhope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.\""], ["\"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,\r\nfor she loves to be of use.

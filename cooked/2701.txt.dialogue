You know the old man's\r\nivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick\r\nback, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then,\r\npresto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking\r\nat it. But what was still more curious, Flask--you know how curious all\r\ndreams are--through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be\r\nthinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that\r\nkick from Ahab. 'Why,' thinks I, 'what's the row? It's not a real leg,\r\nonly a false leg.' And there's a mighty difference between a living\r\nthump and a dead thump. That's what makes a blow from the hand, Flask,\r\nfifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. The living\r\nmember--that makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to\r\nmyself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against\r\nthat cursed pyramid--so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all\r\nthe while, I say, I was thinking to myself, 'what's his leg now, but\r\na cane--a whalebone cane. Yes,' thinks I, 'it was only a playful\r\ncudgelling--in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me--not a base\r\nkick. Besides,' thinks I, 'look at it once; why, the end of it--the foot\r\npart--what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer\r\nkicked me, THERE'S a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled\r\ndown to a point only.' But now comes the greatest joke of the\r\ndream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of\r\nbadger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the\r\nshoulders, and slews me round. 'What are you 'bout?' says he. Slid! man,\r\nbut I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was over\r\nthe fright. 'What am I about?' says I at last. 'And what business is\r\nthat of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do YOU want a kick?'\r\nBy the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned round his\r\nstern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a\r\nclout--what do you think, I saw?--why thunder alive, man, his stern\r\nwas stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on second\r\nthoughts, 'I guess I won't kick you, old fellow.' 'Wise Stubb,' said he,\r\n'wise Stubb;' and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of\r\nhis own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn't going to stop saying\r\nover his 'wise Stubb, wise Stubb,' I thought I might as well fall to\r\nkicking the pyramid again. But I had only just lifted my foot for it,\r\nwhen he roared out, 'Stop that kicking!' 'Halloa,' says I, 'what's\r\nthe matter now, old fellow?' 'Look ye here,' says he; 'let's argue\r\nthe insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn't he?' 'Yes, he did,' says\r\nI--'right HERE it was.' 'Very good,' says he--'he used his ivory leg,\r\ndidn't he?' 'Yes, he did,' says I. 'Well then,' says he, 'wise Stubb,\r\nwhat have you to complain of? Didn't he kick with right good will? it\r\nwasn't a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you were\r\nkicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It's an\r\nhonour; I consider it an honour. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England the\r\ngreatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made\r\ngarter-knights of; but, be YOUR boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by\r\nold Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; BE kicked by him;\r\naccount his kicks honours; and on no account kick back; for you can't\r\nhelp yourself, wise Stubb. Don't you see that pyramid?' With that, he\r\nall of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into\r\nthe air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock! Now, what\r\ndo you think of that dream, Flask?\""], ["\"I don't know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.'\""], ["\"May be; may be. But it's made a wise man of me, Flask. D'ye see Ahab\r\nstanding there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing\r\nyou can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him,\r\nwhatever he says. Halloa! What's that he shouts? Hark!\""], ["\"What do you think of that now, Flask? ain't there a small drop of\r\nsomething queer about that, eh?

How many barrels\r\nwill thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab? it\r\nwill not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.\""], ["\"Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest\r\na little lower layer. If money's to be the measurer, man, and the\r\naccountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by\r\ngirdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then, let\r\nme tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium HERE!\""], ["\"Hark ye yet again--the little lower layer. All visible objects, man,\r\nare but as pasteboard masks. But in each event--in the living act, the\r\nundoubted deed--there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth\r\nthe mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man\r\nwill strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside\r\nexcept by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that\r\nwall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there's naught beyond. But\r\n'tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength,\r\nwith an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is\r\nchiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale\r\nprincipal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of blasphemy,\r\nman; I'd strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the sun do that,\r\nthen could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play\r\nherein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my master, man,\r\nis even that fair play. Who's over me? Truth hath no confines. Take off\r\nthine eye! more intolerable than fiends' glarings is a doltish\r\nstare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to\r\nanger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing\r\nunsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are small indignity. I\r\nmeant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder Turkish cheeks of\r\nspotted tawn--living, breathing pictures painted by the sun.

See yonder Chilian! he snorts to think of it.\r\nStand up amid the general hurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot,\r\nStarbuck! And what is it? Reckon it.

Stop, now; didn't you say so?\""], ["\"Well, suppose I did? What then? I've part changed my flesh since that\r\ntime, why not my mind? Besides, supposing we ARE loaded with powder\r\nbarrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get\r\nafire in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have\r\npretty red hair, but you couldn't get afire now. Shake yourself; you're\r\nAquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat\r\ncollar. Don't you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine\r\nInsurance companies have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask. But\r\nhark, again, and I'll answer ye the other thing. First take your leg off\r\nfrom the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the rope;\r\nnow listen. What's the mighty difference between holding a mast's\r\nlightning-rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast that hasn't\r\ngot any lightning-rod at all in a storm? Don't you see, you timber-head,\r\nthat no harm can come to the holder of the rod, unless the mast is first\r\nstruck? What are you talking about, then? Not one ship in a hundred\r\ncarries rods, and Ahab,--aye, man, and all of us,--were in no more\r\ndanger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten thousand\r\nships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose you would\r\nhave every man in the world go about with a small lightning-rod running\r\nup the corner of his hat, like a militia officer's skewered feather,\r\nand trailing behind like his sash. Why don't ye be sensible, Flask? it's\r\neasy to be sensible; why don't ye, then? any man with half an eye can be\r\nsensible.\""], ["\"I don't know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.\""], ["\"Yes, when a fellow's soaked through, it's hard to be sensible, that's\r\na fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind; catch the\r\nturn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors\r\nnow as if they were never going to be used again. Tying these two\r\nanchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man's hands behind him. And what\r\nbig generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron fists,\r\nhey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the world is\r\nanchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon long cable,\r\nthough. There, hammer that knot down, and we've done. So; next to\r\ntouching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. I say, just\r\nwring out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at long-togs\r\nso, Flask; but seems to me, a Long tailed coat ought always to be worn\r\nin all storms afloat. The tails tapering down that way, serve to carry\r\noff the water, d'ye see. Same with cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end\r\neave-troughs, Flask. No more monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me; I\r\nmust mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a beaver; so. Halloa! whew!\r\nthere goes my tarpaulin overboard; Lord, Lord, that the winds that come\r\nfrom heaven should be so unmannerly! This is a nasty night, lad.\""], ["\"Um, um, um. Stop that thunder!

Thou'st hit the world by that.\""], ["\"I know not, sir, but I was born there.\""], ["\"In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it's good.

Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and\r\nno more.--Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.\""], ["\"He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he baulks.\r\nNow I don't like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he wears it\r\nlike a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he won't put\r\nhis head into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin?\r\nAnd now I'm ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It's like turning an old\r\ncoat; going to bring the flesh on the other side now. I don't like this\r\ncobbling sort of business--I don't like it at all; it's undignified;\r\nit's not my place. Let tinkers' brats do tinkerings; we are their\r\nbetters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin, fair-and-square\r\nmathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at the beginning, and\r\nis at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at the conclusion; not\r\na cobbler's job, that's at an end in the middle, and at the beginning at\r\nthe end. It's the old woman's tricks to be giving cobbling jobs. Lord!\r\nwhat an affection all old women have for tinkers. I know an old woman of\r\nsixty-five who ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once. And that's\r\nthe reason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore, when\r\nI kept my job-shop in the Vineyard; they might have taken it into their\r\nlonely old heads to run off with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at\r\nsea but snow-caps. Let me see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay\r\nover the same with pitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the\r\nsnap-spring over the ship's stern. Were ever such things done before\r\nwith a coffin? Some superstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied\r\nup in the rigging, ere they would do the job. But I'm made of knotty\r\nAroostook hemlock; I don't budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing\r\nabout with a grave-yard tray! But never mind. We workers in woods make\r\nbridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We\r\nwork by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask\r\nthe why and wherefore of our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling,\r\nand then we stash it if we can. Hem! I'll do the job, now, tenderly.\r\nI'll have me--let's see--how many in the ship's company, all told? But\r\nI've forgotten. Any way, I'll have me thirty separate, Turk's-headed\r\nlife-lines, each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin. Then,\r\nif the hull go down, there'll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for\r\none coffin, a sight not seen very often beneath the sun! Come hammer,\r\ncaulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let's to it.\""], ["\"Back, lad; I will be with ye again presently. He goes! Not this hand\r\ncomplies with my humor more genially than that boy.--Middle aisle of a\r\nchurch! What's here?\""], ["\"Life-buoy, sir. Mr. Starbuck's orders. Oh, look, sir! Beware the\r\nhatchway!\""], ["\"Thank ye, man. Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.\""], ["\"Sir? The hatchway? oh! So it does, sir, so it does.\""], ["\"Art not thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from thy\r\nshop?\""], ["\"I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?\""], ["\"Well enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?\""], ["\"Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but\r\nthey've set me now to turning it into something else.\""], ["\"Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,\r\nmonopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the\r\nnext day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those\r\nsame coffins? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a\r\njack-of-all-trades.\""], ["\"But I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do.\""], ["\"The gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a\r\ncoffin? The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the\r\ncraters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in\r\nhand. Dost thou never?\""], ["\"Sing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I'm indifferent enough, sir, for that; but\r\nthe reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because there\r\nwas none in his spade, sir. But the caulking mallet is full of it. Hark\r\nto it.\""], ["\"Faith, sir, I've--\""], ["\"Faith? What's that?\""], ["\"Why, faith, sir, it's only a sort of exclamation-like--that's all,\r\nsir.\""], ["\"Um, um; go on.\""], ["\"I was about to say, sir, that--\""], ["\"Art thou a silk-worm?

On such\r\na day--very much such a sweetness as this--I struck my first whale--a\r\nboy-harpooneer of eighteen! Forty--forty--forty years ago!--ago! Forty\r\nyears of continual whaling! forty years of privation, and peril, and\r\nstorm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab\r\nforsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors\r\nof the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not\r\nspent three ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the desolation\r\nof solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a Captain's\r\nexclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the\r\ngreen country without--oh, weariness! heaviness! Guinea-coast slavery of\r\nsolitary command!--when I think of all this; only half-suspected, not so\r\nkeenly known to me before--and how for forty years I have fed upon dry\r\nsalted fare--fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil!--when the\r\npoorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and broken the\r\nworld's fresh bread to my mouldy crusts--away, whole oceans away, from\r\nthat young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed for Cape Horn\r\nthe next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow--wife?\r\nwife?--rather a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I widowed that poor\r\ngirl when I married her, Starbuck; and then, the madness, the frenzy,\r\nthe boiling blood and the smoking brow, with which, for a thousand\r\nlowerings old Ahab has furiously, foamingly chased his prey--more a\r\ndemon than a man!--aye, aye! what a forty years' fool--fool--old fool,\r\nhas old Ahab been! Why this strife of the chase? why weary, and palsy\r\nthe arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance? how the richer or\r\nbetter is Ahab now? Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that with this\r\nweary load I bear, one poor leg should have been snatched from under\r\nme? Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep.\r\nLocks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes! But do I look\r\nvery old, so very, very old, Starbuck? I feel deadly faint, bowed, and\r\nhumped, as though I were Adam, staggering beneath the piled\r\ncenturies since Paradise. God! God! God!--crack my heart!--stave my\r\nbrain!--mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey hairs, have\r\nI lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus intolerably old?\r\nClose! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a human eye; it is\r\nbetter than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze upon God. By\r\nthe green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is the magic glass,\r\nman; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no; stay on board, on\r\nboard!--lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick.\r\nThat hazard shall not be thine.

Away! let us away!--this instant let me alter\r\nthe course! How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl\r\non our way to see old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some such\r\nmild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket.\""], ["\"They have, they have. I have seen them--some summer days in the\r\nmorning.

She promised that my boy, every morning,\r\nshould be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father's\r\nsail! Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for Nantucket!

For ere they\r\ndrown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface; then rise again,\r\nto sink for evermore. So with Moby Dick--two days he's floated--tomorrow\r\nwill be the third.

Helm\r\nthere; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day\r\nagain! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the\r\nangels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a\r\nfairer day could not dawn upon that world. Here's food for thought, had\r\nAhab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels;\r\nTHAT'S tingling enough for mortal man! to think's audacity. God only has\r\nthat right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a\r\ncalmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much\r\nfor that. And yet, I've sometimes thought my brain was very calm--frozen\r\ncalm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents\r\nturned to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing now; this\r\nmoment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it's like that sort\r\nof common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy clefts of\r\nGreenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow it; they whip\r\nit about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they\r\ncling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison\r\ncorridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and ventilated them, and\r\nnow comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces. Out upon it!--it's\r\ntainted. Were I the wind, I'd blow no more on such a wicked, miserable\r\nworld. I'd crawl somewhere to a cave, and slink there. And yet, 'tis a\r\nnoble and heroic thing, the wind! who ever conquered it? In every fight\r\nit has the last and bitterest blow. Run tilting at it, and you but run\r\nthrough it. Ha! a coward wind that strikes stark naked men, but will not\r\nstand to receive a single blow. Even Ahab is a braver thing--a nobler\r\nthing than THAT. Would now the wind but had a body; but all the things\r\nthat most exasperate and outrage mortal man, all these things are\r\nbodiless, but only bodiless as objects, not as agents. There's a most\r\nspecial, a most cunning, oh, a most malicious difference! And yet, I\r\nsay again, and swear it now, that there's something all glorious and\r\ngracious in the wind. These warm Trade Winds, at least, that in the\r\nclear heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast, vigorous\r\nmildness; and veer not from their mark, however the baser currents of\r\nthe sea may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift\r\nand swerve about, uncertain where to go at last. And by the eternal\r\nPoles! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on; these\r\nTrades, or something like them--something so unchangeable, and full as\r\nstrong, blow my keeled soul along!

So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But\r\nlet me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there's\r\ntime for that. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and\r\nnot changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of\r\nNantucket! The same!--the same!--the same to Noah as to me.

Seeing how matters stood, and\r\nwhat a noble great whale it was--the noblest and biggest I ever saw,\r\nsir, in my life--I resolved to capture him, spite of the boiling rage\r\nhe seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would get loose, or\r\nthe tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil of a boat's\r\ncrew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped\r\ninto my first mate's boat--Mr. Mounttop's here (by the way,\r\nCaptain--Mounttop; Mounttop--the captain);--as I was saying, I jumped\r\ninto Mounttop's boat, which, d'ye see, was gunwale and gunwale\r\nwith mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old\r\ngreat-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir--hearts and souls\r\nalive, man--the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat--both\r\neyes out--all befogged and bedeadened with black foam--the whale's tail\r\nlooming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble\r\nsteeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with\r\na blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the\r\nsecond iron, to toss it overboard--down comes the tail like a Lima\r\ntower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and,\r\nflukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was\r\nall chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I seized\r\nhold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that\r\nlike a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at the same\r\ninstant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down like a\r\nflash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me\r\ncaught me here\"", "\"yes,\r\ncaught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell's flames, I was\r\nthinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb ript\r\nits way along the flesh--clear along the whole length of my arm--came\r\nout nigh my wrist, and up I floated;--and that gentleman there will tell\r\nyou the rest (by the way, captain--Dr. Bunger, ship's surgeon: Bunger,\r\nmy lad,--the captain).

No possible way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully\r\nincorporate it into his general bodily system. Yes, Captain Boomer, if\r\nyou are quick enough about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the\r\nsake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other, why in that\r\ncase the arm is yours; only let the whale have another chance at you\r\nshortly, that's all.\""], ["\"Look ye here, then,\"", "\"look ye here--HERE--can ye\r\nsmoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith,\"", "\"if thou could'st, blacksmith, glad enough would I lay\r\nmy head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes.\r\nAnswer!

Looking-Glass house", "One thing was certain, that the WHITE kitten had had nothing to do with\r\nit:--it was the black kitten's fault entirely. For the white kitten had\r\nbeen having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of\r\nan hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it\r\nCOULDN'T have had any hand in the mischief.", "The way Dinah washed her children's faces was this: first she held the\r\npoor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she\r\nrubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and\r\njust now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was\r\nlying quite still and trying to purr--no doubt feeling that it was all\r\nmeant for its good.", "But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon,\r\nand so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great\r\narm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been\r\nhaving a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been\r\ntrying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all\r\ncome undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all\r\nknots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the\r\nmiddle.", "%(dialogue)s cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and\r\ngiving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace.\r\n%(dialogue)s she added, looking reproachfully at the old\r\ncat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage--and then she\r\nscrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted\r\nwith her, and began winding up the ball again. But she didn't get on\r\nvery fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and\r\nsometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to\r\nwatch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one\r\npaw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it\r\nmight.", "%(dialogue)s Alice began. %(dialogue)s Here Alice wound two or three turns of the\r\nworsted round the kitten's neck, just to see how it would look: this led\r\nto a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards\r\nand yards of it got unwound again.", "%(dialogue)s Alice went on as soon as they were\r\ncomfortably settled again, %(dialogue)s she\r\nwent on, holding up one finger. %(dialogue)s (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) 'Her paw went into your\r\neye? Well, that's YOUR fault, for keeping your eyes open--if you'd\r\nshut them tight up, it wouldn't have happened. Now don't make any more\r\nexcuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail\r\njust as I had put down the saucer of milk before her! What, you were\r\nthirsty, were you? How do you know she wasn't thirsty too? Now for\r\nnumber three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasn't\r\nlooking!", "%(dialogue)s she went on,\r\ntalking more to herself than the kitten. 'What WOULD they do at the end\r\nof a year? I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came.\r\nOr--let me see--suppose each punishment was to be going without a\r\ndinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without\r\nfifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldn't mind THAT much! I'd far rather\r\ngo without them than eat them!", "%(dialogue)s cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap\r\nher hands. 'And I do so WISH it was true! I'm sure the woods look sleepy\r\nin the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown.", "%(dialogue)s And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice\r\nused to say, beginning with her favourite phrase %(dialogue)s She\r\nhad had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before--all\r\nbecause Alice had begun with %(dialogue)s and\r\nher sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn't,\r\nbecause there were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at last\r\nto say, %(dialogue)s\r\nAnd once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in\r\nher ear, %(dialogue)s", "But this is taking us away from Alice's speech to the kitten. %(dialogue)s And Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it\r\nup before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing\r\ndidn't succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldn't\r\nfold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held it up to the\r\nLooking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was--%(dialogue)s she added, %(dialogue)s", "'Now, if you'll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, I'll tell you\r\nall my ideas about Looking-glass House. First, there's the room you can\r\nsee through the glass--that's just the same as our drawing room, only\r\nthe things go the other way. I can see all of it when I get upon a\r\nchair--all but the bit behind the fireplace. Oh! I do so wish I could\r\nsee THAT bit! I want so much to know whether they've a fire in the\r\nwinter: you never CAN tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and then\r\nsmoke comes up in that room too--but that may be only pretence, just to\r\nmake it look as if they had a fire. Well then, the books are something\r\nlike our books, only the words go the wrong way; I know that, because\r\nI've held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in\r\nthe other room.", "%(dialogue)s She was up on the chimney-piece while she\r\nsaid this, though she hardly knew how she had got there. And certainly\r\nthe glass WAS beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist.", "In another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly\r\ndown into the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was\r\nto look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite\r\npleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as\r\nthe one she had left behind. %(dialogue)s thought Alice: %(dialogue)s", "Then she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from\r\nthe old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest\r\nwas as different as possible. For instance, the pictures on the\r\nwall next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on\r\nthe chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the\r\nLooking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her.", "%(dialogue)s Alice thought to\r\nherself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among\r\nthe cinders: but in another moment, with a little %(dialogue)s of surprise, she\r\nwas down on her hands and knees watching them. The chessmen were walking\r\nabout, two and two!", "%(dialogue)s Alice said (in a whisper, for\r\nfear of frightening them), %(dialogue)s she went on, as she\r\nput her head closer down, %(dialogue)s", "Here something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her\r\nturn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and\r\nbegin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would\r\nhappen next.", "%(dialogue)s the White Queen cried out as she rushed\r\npast the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders.\r\n%(dialogue)s and she began scrambling wildly\r\nup the side of the fender.", "%(dialogue)s said the King, rubbing his nose, which had been\r\nhurt by the fall. He had a right to be a LITTLE annoyed with the Queen,\r\nfor he was covered with ashes from head to foot.", "Alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was\r\nnearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen and\r\nset her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter.", "The Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had\r\nquite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing\r\nbut hug the little Lily in silence. As soon as she had recovered her\r\nbreath a little, she called out to the White King, who was sitting\r\nsulkily among the ashes, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if\r\nhe thought that was the most likely place to find one.", "%(dialogue)s panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath.\r\n%(dialogue)s", "Alice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar,\r\ntill at last she said, %(dialogue)s But the King\r\ntook no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither\r\nhear her nor see her.", "So Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly\r\nthan she had lifted the Queen, that she mightn't take his breath away:\r\nbut, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well dust\r\nhim a little, he was so covered with ashes.", "She said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face\r\nas the King made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible\r\nhand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but\r\nhis eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder\r\nand rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let\r\nhim drop upon the floor.", "%(dialogue)s she cried out, quite\r\nforgetting that the King couldn't hear her. %(dialogue)s she\r\nadded, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the\r\nQueen.", "The King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and\r\nAlice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room\r\nto see if she could find any water to throw over him. However, she could\r\nfind nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she\r\nfound he had recovered, and he and the Queen were talking together in a\r\nfrightened whisper--so low, that Alice could hardly hear what they said.", "The King was saying, %(dialogue)s", "To which the Queen replied, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s the King went on, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s the Queen said, %(dialogue)s", "Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous\r\nmemorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought\r\nstruck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some\r\nway over his shoulder, and began writing for him.", "The poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil\r\nfor some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him,\r\nand at last he panted out, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said the Queen, looking over the book (in which\r\nAlice had put %(dialogue)s) %(dialogue)s", "There was a book lying near Alice on the table, and while she sat\r\nwatching the White King (for she was still a little anxious about him,\r\nand had the ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted again),\r\nshe turned over the leaves, to find some part that she could read,\r\n%(dialogue)s she said to herself.", "It was like this.", "\r\n             YKCOWREBBAJ", "     sevot yhtils eht dna,gillirb sawT'\r\n      ebaw eht ni elbmig dna eryg diD\r\n        ,sevogorob eht erew ysmim llA\r\n       .ebargtuo shtar emom eht dnA", "\r\nShe puzzled over this for some time, but at last a bright thought struck\r\nher. %(dialogue)s", "This was the poem that Alice read.", "\r\n             JABBERWOCKY", "     'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\r\n      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;\r\n     All mimsy were the borogoves,\r\n      And the mome raths outgrabe.", "     %(dialogue)s", "     He took his vorpal sword in hand:\r\n      Long time the manxome foe he sought--\r\n     So rested he by the Tumtum tree,\r\n      And stood awhile in thought.", "     And as in uffish thought he stood,\r\n      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,\r\n     Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,\r\n      And burbled as it came!", "     One, two!

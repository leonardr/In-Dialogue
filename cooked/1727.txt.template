[" EBOOK THE ODYSSEY ***", "", "\r\nProduced by Jim Tinsley", "", "", "", "", "THE ODYSSEY", "\r\n  rendered into English\r\n  prose for the use of\r\n  those who cannot\r\n  read the original", "\r\nBy Samuel Butler", "", "\r\nPREFACE TO FIRST EDITION", "This translation is intended to supplement a work entitled %(dialogue)s, which I published in 1897. I could not give\r\nthe whole %(dialogue)s in that book without making it unwieldy, I therefore\r\nepitomised my translation, which was already completed and which I now\r\npublish in full.", "I shall not here argue the two main points dealt with in the work just\r\nmentioned; I have nothing either to add to, or to withdraw from, what I\r\nhave there written. The points in question are:", "(1) that the %(dialogue)s was written entirely at, and drawn entirely\r\nfrom, the place now called Trapani on the West Coast of Sicily, alike\r\nas regards the Phaeacian and the Ithaca scenes; while the voyages of\r\nUlysses, when once he is within easy reach of Sicily, solve themselves\r\ninto a periplus of the island, practically from Trapani back to Trapani,\r\nvia the Lipari islands, the Straits of Messina, and the island of\r\nPantellaria.", "(2) That the poem was entirely written by a very young woman, who lived\r\nat the place now called Trapani, and introduced herself into her work\r\nunder the name of Nausicaa.", "The main arguments on which I base the first of these somewhat startling\r\ncontentions, have been prominently and repeatedly before the English\r\nand Italian public ever since they appeared (without rejoinder) in the\r\n%(dialogue)s for January 30 and February 20, 1892. Both contentions were\r\nurged (also without rejoinder) in the Johnian %(dialogue)s for the Lent and\r\nOctober terms of the same year. Nothing to which I should reply\r\nhas reached me from any quarter, and knowing how anxiously I have\r\nendeavoured to learn the existence of any flaws in my argument, I begin\r\nto feel some confidence that, did such flaws exist, I should have heard,\r\nat any rate about some of them, before now. Without, therefore, for\r\na moment pretending to think that scholars generally acquiesce in my\r\nconclusions, I shall act as thinking them little likely so to gainsay me\r\nas that it will be incumbent upon me to reply, and shall confine myself\r\nto translating the %(dialogue)s for English readers, with such notes as\r\nI think will be found useful. Among these I would especially call\r\nattention to one on xxii. 465-473 which Lord Grimthorpe has kindly\r\nallowed me to make public.", "I have repeated several of the illustrations used in %(dialogue)s, and have added two which I hope may bring the outer court\r\nof Ulysses' house more vividly before the reader. I should like to\r\nexplain that the presence of a man and a dog in one illustration is\r\naccidental, and was not observed by me till I developed the negative. In\r\nan appendix I have also reprinted the paragraphs explanatory of the\r\nplan of Ulysses' house, together with the plan itself. The reader is\r\nrecommended to study this plan with some attention.", "In the preface to my translation of the %(dialogue)s I have given my views as\r\nto the main principles by which a translator should be guided, and need\r\nnot repeat them here, beyond pointing out that the initial liberty of\r\ntranslating poetry into prose involves the continual taking of more\r\nor less liberty throughout the translation; for much that is right in\r\npoetry is wrong in prose, and the exigencies of readable prose are the\r\nfirst things to be considered in a prose translation. That the reader,\r\nhowever, may see how far I have departed from strict construe, I will\r\nprint here Messrs. Butcher and Lang's translation of the sixty lines or\r\nso of the %(dialogue)s Their translation runs:", "  Tell me, Muse, of that man, so ready at need, who wandered\r\n  far and wide, after he had sacked the sacred citadel of\r\n  Troy, and many were the men whose towns he saw and whose\r\n  mind he learnt, yea, and many the woes he suffered in his\r\n  heart on the deep, striving to win his own life and the\r\n  return of his company. Nay, but even so he saved not his\r\n  company, though he desired it sore. For through the\r\n  blindness of their own hearts they perished, fools, who\r\n  devoured the oxen of Helios Hyperion: but the god took from\r\n  them their day of returning. Of these things, goddess,\r\n  daughter of Zeus, whencesoever thou hast heard thereof,\r\n  declare thou even unto us.", "  Now all the rest, as many as fled from sheer destruction,\r\n  were at home, and had escaped both war and sea, but\r\n  Odysseus only, craving for his wife and for his homeward\r\n  path, the lady nymph Calypso held, that fair goddess, in her\r\n  hollow caves, longing to have him for her lord. But when\r\n  now the year had come in the courses of the seasons,\r\n  wherein the gods had ordained that he should return home to\r\n  Ithaca, not even there was he quit of labours, not even\r\n  among his own; but all the gods had pity on him save\r\n  Poseidon, who raged continually against godlike Odysseus,\r\n  till he came to his own country. Howbeit Poseidon had now\r\n  departed for the distant Ethiopians, the Ethiopians that are\r\n  sundered in twain, the uttermost of men, abiding some where\r\n  Hyperion sinks and some where he rises. There he looked to\r\n  receive his hecatomb of bulls and rams, there he made merry\r\n  sitting at the feast, but the other gods were gathered in\r\n  the halls of Olympian Zeus. Then among them the father of\r\n  men and gods began to speak, for he bethought him in his\r\n  heart of noble Aegisthus, whom the son of Agamemnon,\r\n  far-famed Orestes, slew. Thinking upon him he spake out among\r\n  the Immortals:", "  'Lo you now, how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For of\r\n  us they say comes evil, whereas they even of themselves,\r\n  through the blindness of their own hearts, have sorrows\r\n  beyond that which is ordained. Even as of late Aegisthus,\r\n  beyond that which was ordained, took to him the wedded wife\r\n  of the son of Atreus, and killed her lord on his return,\r\n  and that with sheer doom before his eyes, since we had\r\n  warned him by the embassy of Hermes the keen-sighted, the\r\n  slayer of Argos, that he should neither kill the man, nor\r\n  woo his wife. For the son of Atreus shall be avenged at the\r\n  hand of Orestes, so soon as he shall come to man's estate\r\n  and long for his own country. So spake Hermes, yet he\r\n  prevailed not on the heart of Aegisthus, for all his good\r\n  will; but now hath he paid one price for all.'", "  And the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, saying: 'O\r\n  father, our father Cronides, throned in the highest; that\r\n  man assuredly lies in a death that is his due; so perish\r\n  likewise all who work such deeds! But my heart is rent for\r\n  wise Odysseus, the hapless one, who far from his friends\r\n  this long while suffereth affliction in a sea-girt isle,\r\n  where is the navel of the sea, a woodland isle, and\r\n  therein a goddess hath her habitation, the daughter of the\r\n  wizard Atlas, who knows the depths of every sea, and\r\n  himself upholds the tall pillars which keep earth and sky\r\n  asunder. His daughter it is that holds the hapless man in\r\n  sorrow: and ever with soft and guileful tales she is\r\n  wooing him to forgetfulness of Ithaca. But Odysseus\r\n  yearning to see if it were but the smoke leap upwards from\r\n  his own land, hath a desire to die. As for thee, thine\r\n  heart regardeth it not at all, Olympian! What! Did not\r\n  Odysseus by the ships of the Argives make thee free\r\n  offering of sacrifice in the wide Trojan land? Wherefore\r\n  wast thou then so wroth with him, O Zeus?'", "The %(dialogue)s (as every one knows) abounds in passages borrowed from the\r\n%(dialogue)s; I had wished to print these in a slightly different type, with\r\nmarginal references to the %(dialogue)s and had marked them to this end in\r\nmy MS. I found, however, that the translation would be thus hopelessly\r\nscholasticised, and abandoned my intention. I would nevertheless urge on\r\nthose who have the management of our University presses, that they would\r\nrender a great service to students if they would publish a Greek text of\r\nthe %(dialogue)s with the Iliadic passages printed in a different type, and\r\nwith marginal references. I have given the British Museum a copy of the\r\n%(dialogue)s with the Iliadic passages underlined and referred to in MS.;\r\nI have also given an %(dialogue)s marked with all the Odyssean passages, and\r\ntheir references; but copies of both the %(dialogue)s and %(dialogue)s so marked\r\nought to be within easy reach of all students.", "Any one who at the present day discusses the questions that have arisen\r\nround the %(dialogue)s since Wolf's time, without keeping it well before\r\nhis reader's mind that the %(dialogue)s was demonstrably written from one\r\nsingle neighbourhood, and hence (even though nothing else pointed to\r\nthis conclusion) presumably by one person only--that it was written\r\ncertainly before 750, and in all probability before 1000 B.C.--that\r\nthe writer of this very early poem was demonstrably familiar with the\r\n%(dialogue)s as we now have it, borrowing as freely from those books whose\r\ngenuineness has been most impugned, as from those which are admitted to\r\nbe by Homer--any one who fails to keep these points before his readers,\r\nis hardly dealing equitably by them. Any one on the other hand, who will\r\nmark his %(dialogue)s and his %(dialogue)s from the copies in the British Museum\r\nabove referred to, and who will draw the only inference that common\r\nsense can draw from the presence of so many identical passages in both\r\npoems, will, I believe, find no difficulty in assigning their proper\r\nvalue to a large number of books here and on the Continent that at\r\npresent enjoy considerable reputations. Furthermore, and this perhaps\r\nis an advantage better worth securing, he will find that many puzzles of\r\nthe %(dialogue)s cease to puzzle him on the discovery that they arise from\r\nover-saturation with the %(dialogue)s", "Other difficulties will also disappear as soon as the development of the\r\npoem in the writer's mind is understood. I have dealt with this at some\r\nlength in pp. 251-261 of %(dialogue)s. Briefly, the\r\n%(dialogue)s consists of two distinct poems: (1) The Return of Ulysses,\r\nwhich alone the Muse is asked to sing in the opening lines of the poem.\r\nThis poem includes the Phaeacian episode, and the account of Ulysses'\r\nadventures as told by himself in Books ix.-xii. It consists of lines\r\n1-79 (roughly) of Book i., of line 28 of Book v., and thence without\r\nintermission to the middle of line 187 of Book xiii., at which point the\r\noriginal scheme was abandoned.", "(2) The story of Penelope and the suitors, with the episode of\r\nTelemachus' voyage to Pylos. This poem begins with line 80 (roughly)\r\nof Book i., is continued to the end of Book iv., and not resumed till\r\nUlysses wakes in the middle of line 187, Book xiii., from whence it\r\ncontinues to the end of Book xxiv.", "In %(dialogue)s, I wrote:", "   the introduction of lines xi., 115-137 and of line ix.,\r\n   535, with the writing a new council of the gods at the\r\n   beginning of Book v., to take the place of the one that was\r\n   removed to Book i., 1-79, were the only things that were\r\n   done to give even a semblance of unity to the old scheme\r\n   and the new, and to conceal the fact that the Muse, after\r\n   being asked to sing of one subject, spend two-thirds of her\r\n   time in singing a very different one, with a climax for\r\n   which no-one has asked her. For roughly the Return occupies\r\n   eight Books, and Penelope and the Suitors sixteen.", "I believe this to be substantially correct.", "Lastly, to deal with a very unimportant point, I observe that the\r\nLeipsic Teubner edition of 894 makes Books ii. and iii. end with a\r\ncomma. Stops are things of such far more recent date than the %(dialogue)s\r\nthat there does not seem much use in adhering to the text in so small a\r\nmatter; still, from a spirit of mere conservatism, I have preferred\r\nto do so. Why [Greek] at the beginnings of Books ii. and viii., and\r\n[Greek], at the beginning of Book vii. should have initial capitals in\r\nan edition far too careful to admit a supposition of inadvertence, when\r\n[Greek] at the beginning of Books vi. and xiii., and [Greek] at the\r\nbeginning of Book xvii. have no initial capitals, I cannot determine.\r\nNo other Books of the %(dialogue)s have initial capitals except the three\r\nmentioned unless the first word of the Book is a proper name.", "S. BUTLER.", "July 25, 1900.", "", "\r\nPREFACE TO SECOND EDITION", "Butler's Translation of the %(dialogue)s appeared originally in 1900, and\r\nThe Authoress of the Odyssey in 1897. In the preface to the new edition\r\nof %(dialogue)s, which is published simultaneously with this new\r\nedition of the Translation, I have given some account of the genesis of\r\nthe two books.", "The size of the original page has been reduced so as to make both\r\nbooks uniform with Butler's other works; and, fortunately, it has been\r\npossible, by using a smaller type, to get the same number of words into\r\neach page, so that the references remain good, and, with the exception\r\nof a few minor alterations and rearrangements now to be enumerated\r\nso far as they affect the Translation, the new editions are faithful\r\nreprints of the original editions, with misprints and obvious errors\r\ncorrected--no attempt having been made to edit them or to bring them up\r\nto date.", "(a) The Index has been revised.", "(b) Owing to the reduction in the size of the page it has been necessary\r\nto shorten some of the headlines, and here advantage has been taken of\r\nvarious corrections of and additions to the headlines and shoulder-notes\r\nmade by Butler in his own copies of the two books.", "(c) For the most part each of the illustrations now occupies a page,\r\nwhereas in the original editions they generally appeared two on the\r\npage. It has been necessary to reduce the plan of the House of Ulysses.", "On page 153 of %(dialogue)s Butler says: %(dialogue)s This passage is not given in the abridged Story of the\r\n%(dialogue)s at the beginning of the book, but in the Translation it occurs\r\nin these words:", "%(dialogue)s", "It looks as though in the interval between the publication of %(dialogue)s (1897) and of the Translation (1900) Butler had changed his\r\nmind; for in the first case the comparison is between Ulysses and a\r\npaunch full, etc., and in the second it is between Ulysses and a man who\r\nturns a paunch full, etc. The second comparison is perhaps one which a\r\ngreat poet might make.", "In seeing the works through the press I have had the invaluable\r\nassistance of Mr. A. T. Bartholomew of the University Library,\r\nCambridge, and of Mr. Donald S. Robertson, Fellow of Trinity College,\r\nCambridge. To both these friends I give my most cordial thanks for the\r\ncare and skill exercised by them. Mr. Robertson has found time for the\r\nlabour of checking and correcting all the quotations from and references\r\nto the %(dialogue)s and %(dialogue)s and I believe that it could not have been\r\nbetter performed. It was, I know, a pleasure for him; and it would have\r\nbeen a pleasure also for Butler if he could have known that his work was\r\nbeing shepherded by the son of his old friend, Mr. H. R. Robertson, who\r\nmore than half a century ago was a fellow-student with him at Cary's\r\nSchool of Art in Streatham Street, Bloomsbury.", "HENRY FESTING JONES.", "120 MAIDA VALE, W.9.", "4th December, 1921.", "", "\r\nTHE ODYSSEY", "\r\nBook I", "THE GODS IN COUNCIL--MINERVA'S VISIT TO ITHACA--THE CHALLENGE FROM\r\nTELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.", "Tell me, O Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after\r\nhe had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit, and\r\nmany were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted;\r\nmoreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and\r\nbring his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save his\r\nmen, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the\r\ncattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever\r\nreaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, oh daughter of\r\nJove, from whatsoever source you may know them.", "So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely\r\nhome except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return to his wife\r\nand country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him into\r\na large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there came a\r\ntime when the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca; even then,\r\nhowever, when he was among his own people, his troubles were not\r\nyet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him except\r\nNeptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not let him\r\nget home.", "Now Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world's end,\r\nand lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East. {1} He\r\nhad gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying\r\nhimself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house of Olympian\r\nJove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that moment he was\r\nthinking of Aegisthus, who had been killed by Agamemnon's son Orestes;\r\nso he said to the other gods:", "%(dialogue)s", "Then Minerva said, %(dialogue)s", "And Jove said, %(dialogue)s", "And Minerva said, %(dialogue)s", "So saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable,\r\nwith which she can fly like the wind over land or sea; she grasped the\r\nredoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, wherewith\r\nshe quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her, and down she\r\ndarted from the topmost summits of Olympus, whereon forthwith she was\r\nin Ithaca, at the gateway of Ulysses' house, disguised as a visitor,\r\nMentes, chief of the Taphians, and she held a bronze spear in her hand.\r\nThere she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of the oxen which\r\nthey had killed and eaten, and playing draughts in front of the house.\r\nMen-servants and pages were bustling about to wait upon them, some\r\nmixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls, some cleaning down the\r\ntables with wet sponges and laying them out again, and some cutting up\r\ngreat quantities of meat.", "Telemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting moodily\r\namong the suitors thinking about his brave father, and how he would send\r\nthem flying out of the house, if he were to come to his own again and\r\nbe honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them, he\r\ncaught sight of Minerva and went straight to the gate, for he was vexed\r\nthat a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance. He took her right\r\nhand in his own, and bade her give him her spear. %(dialogue)s said he,\r\n%(dialogue)s", "He led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they were\r\nwithin he took her spear and set it in the spear-stand against a strong\r\nbearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy father, and\r\nhe conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which he threw a\r\ncloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet,{2} and he set\r\nanother seat near her for himself, away from the suitors, that she might\r\nnot be annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence, and that he\r\nmight ask her more freely about his father.", "A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and\r\npoured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she\r\ndrew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and\r\noffered them many good things of what there was in the house, the carver\r\nfetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their\r\nside, and a manservant brought them wine and poured it out for them.", "Then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and seats.\r\n{3} Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids went\r\nround with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine\r\nand water, and they laid their hands upon the good things that were\r\nbefore them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink they wanted\r\nmusic and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments of a banquet,\r\nso a servant brought a lyre to Phemius, whom they compelled perforce\r\nto sing to them.

He was then coming from\r\nEphyra, where he had been to beg poison for his arrows from Ilus, son of\r\nMermerus. Ilus feared the ever-living gods and would not give him any,\r\nbut my father let him have some, for he was very fond of him.

He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the\r\nstranger had been a god, so he went straight to where the suitors were\r\nsitting.", "Phemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he\r\ntold the sad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had laid\r\nupon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his song from\r\nher room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase, not alone, but\r\nattended by two of her handmaids. When she reached the suitors she stood\r\nby one of the bearing posts that supported the roof of the cloisters {8}\r\nwith a staid maiden on either side of her.

A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops,\r\nthe son of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of blazing torches.\r\nLaertes had bought her with his own money when she was quite young; he\r\ngave the worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect to her\r\nin his household as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not take\r\nher to his bed for he feared his wife's resentment. {14} She it was who\r\nnow lighted Telemachus to his room, and she loved him better than any of\r\nthe other women in the house did, for she had nursed him when he was a\r\nbaby.

Our best men all of them fell there--Ajax, Achilles,\r\nPatroclus peer of gods in counsel, and my own dear son Antilochus, a man\r\nsingularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. But we suffered much more\r\nthan this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story? Though\r\nyou were to stay here and question me for five years, or even six, I\r\ncould not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered, and you would turn\r\nhomeward weary of my tale before it ended. Nine long years did we try\r\nevery kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was against us; during\r\nall this time there was no one who could compare with your father in\r\nsubtlety--if indeed you are his son--I can hardly believe my eyes--and\r\nyou talk just like him too--no one would say that people of such\r\ndifferent ages could speak so much alike. He and I never had any kind\r\nof difference from first to last neither in camp nor council, but in\r\nsingleness of heart and purpose we advised the Argives how all might be\r\nordered for the best.", "\"When, however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting sail\r\nin our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit to vex the\r\nArgives on their homeward voyage; for they had not all been either\r\nwise or understanding, and hence many came to a bad end through the\r\ndispleasure of Jove's daughter Minerva, who brought about a quarrel\r\nbetween the two sons of Atreus.", "\"The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should be, for\r\nit was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they explained\r\nwhy they had called the people together, it seemed that Menelaus was\r\nfor sailing homeward at once, and this displeased Agamemnon, who thought\r\nthat we should wait till we had offered hecatombs to appease the anger\r\nof Minerva. Fool that he was, he might have known that he would not\r\nprevail with her, for when the gods have made up their minds they do not\r\nchange them lightly. So the two stood bandying hard words, whereon the\r\nAchaeans sprang to their feet with a cry that rent the air, and were of\r\ntwo minds as to what they should do.", "\"That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatching\r\nmischief against us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships into\r\nthe water and put our goods with our women on board, while the rest,\r\nabout half in number, stayed behind with Agamemnon. We--the other\r\nhalf--embarked and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven had\r\nsmoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices to the\r\ngods, for we were longing to get home; cruel Jove, however, did not yet\r\nmean that we should do so, and raised a second quarrel in the course of\r\nwhich some among us turned their ships back again, and sailed away under\r\nUlysses to make their peace with Agamemnon; but I, and all the ships\r\nthat were with me pressed forward, for I saw that mischief was brewing.\r\nThe son of Tydeus went on also with me, and his crews with him. Later on\r\nMenelaus joined us at Lesbos, and found us making up our minds about our\r\ncourse--for we did not know whether to go outside Chios by the island\r\nof Psyra, keeping this to our left, or inside Chios, over against the\r\nstormy headland of Mimas. So we asked heaven for a sign, and were shown\r\none to the effect that we should be soonest out of danger if we headed\r\nour ships across the open sea to Euboea. This we therefore did, and a\r\nfair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage during the night to\r\nGeraestus, {29} where we offered many sacrifices to Neptune for\r\nhaving helped us so far on our way.

Then he offered many\r\nburnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated many temples with tapestries\r\nand gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his expectations.", "\"Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good terms\r\nwith one another. When we got to Sunium, which is the point of Athens,\r\nApollo with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of\r\nMenelaus' ship (and never man knew better how to handle a vessel in\r\nrough weather) so that he died then and there with the helm in his hand,\r\nand Menelaus, though very anxious to press forward, had to wait in order\r\nto bury his comrade and give him his due funeral rites. Presently, when\r\nhe too could put to sea again, and had sailed on as far as the Malean\r\nheads, Jove counselled evil against him and made it blow hard till the\r\nwaves ran mountains high. Here he divided his fleet and took the one\r\nhalf towards Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about the waters of\r\nthe river Iardanus. There is a high headland hereabouts stretching out\r\ninto the sea from a place called Gortyn, and all along this part of the\r\ncoast as far as Phaestus the sea runs high when there is a south wind\r\nblowing, but after Phaestus the coast is more protected, for a small\r\nheadland can make a great shelter. Here this part of the fleet was\r\ndriven on to the rocks and wrecked; but the crews just managed to save\r\nthemselves. As for the other five ships, they were taken by winds and\r\nseas to Egypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold and substance among\r\npeople of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at home plotted his\r\nevil deed. For seven years after he had killed Agamemnon he ruled in\r\nMycene, and the people were obedient under him, but in the eighth year\r\nOrestes came back from Athens to be his bane, and killed the murderer\r\nof his father.

When she had done bleeding and was quite dead, they cut\r\nher up. They cut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them\r\nround in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the top\r\nof them; then Nestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over\r\nthem, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits in\r\ntheir hands. When the thighs were burned and they had tasted the inward\r\nmeats, they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces on the\r\nspits and toasted them over the fire.", "Meanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor's youngest daughter, washed\r\nTelemachus.

As regards your questions, however, I will not\r\nprevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you without concealment all\r\nthat the old man of the sea told me.", "\"I was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt, for\r\nmy hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods are very\r\nstrict about having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far as a ship\r\ncan sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her, there is an\r\nisland called Pharos--it has a good harbour from which vessels can\r\nget out into open sea when they have taken in water--and here the gods\r\nbecalmed me twenty days without so much as a breath of fair wind to help\r\nme forward. We should have run clean out of provisions and my men would\r\nhave starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon me and saved me in\r\nthe person of Idothea, daughter to Proteus, the old man of the sea, for\r\nshe had taken a great fancy to me.", "\"She came to me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for the\r\nmen used to go with their barbed hooks, all over the island in the\r\nhope of catching a fish or two to save them from the pangs of hunger.\r\n'Stranger,' said she, 'it seems to me that you like starving in this\r\nway--at any rate it does not greatly trouble you, for you stick here day\r\nafter day, without even trying to get away though your men are dying by\r\ninches.'", "\"'Let me tell you,' said I, 'whichever of the goddesses you may happen\r\nto be, that I am not staying here of my own accord, but must have\r\noffended the gods that live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for the gods\r\nknow everything, which of the immortals it is that is hindering me in\r\nthis way, and tell me also how I may sail the sea so as to reach my\r\nhome.'", "\"'Stranger,' replied she, 'I will make it all quite clear to you. There\r\nis an old immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and whose name\r\nis Proteus. He is an Egyptian, and people say he is my father; he is\r\nNeptune's head man and knows every inch of ground all over the bottom of\r\nthe sea. If you can snare him and hold him tight, he will tell you about\r\nyour voyage, what courses you are to take, and how you are to sail the\r\nsea so as to reach your home. He will also tell you, if you so will, all\r\nthat has been going on at your house both good and bad, while you have\r\nbeen away on your long and dangerous journey.'", "\"'Can you show me,' said I, 'some stratagem by means of which I may\r\ncatch this old god without his suspecting it and finding me out? For a\r\ngod is not easily caught--not by a mortal man.'", "\"'Stranger,' said she, 'I will make it all quite clear to you. About the\r\ntime when the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man of the sea\r\ncomes up from under the waves, heralded by the West wind that furs the\r\nwater over his head. As soon as he has come up he lies down, and goes to\r\nsleep in a great sea cave, where the seals--Halosydne's chickens as they\r\ncall them--come up also from the grey sea, and go to sleep in shoals\r\nall round him; and a very strong and fish-like smell do they bring with\r\nthem. {44} Early to-morrow morning I will take you to this place and\r\nwill lay you in ambush. Pick out, therefore, the three best men you have\r\nin your fleet, and I will tell you all the tricks that the old man will\r\nplay you.", "\"'First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then, when he\r\nhas seen them and tallied them on his five fingers, he will go to sleep\r\namong them, as a shepherd among his sheep. The moment you see that he is\r\nasleep seize him; put forth all your strength and hold him fast, for he\r\nwill do his very utmost to get away from you. He will turn himself into\r\nevery kind of creature that goes upon the earth, and will become also\r\nboth fire and water; but you must hold him fast and grip him tighter\r\nand tighter, till he begins to talk to you and comes back to what he was\r\nwhen you saw him go to sleep; then you may slacken your hold and let him\r\ngo; and you can ask him which of the gods it is that is angry with you,\r\nand what you must do to reach your home over the seas.'", "\"Having so said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to\r\nthe place where my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart was\r\nclouded with care as I went along. When I reached my ship we got supper\r\nready, for night was falling, and camped down upon the beach.", "\"When the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, I took the three\r\nmen on whose prowess of all kinds I could most rely, and went along by\r\nthe sea-side, praying heartily to heaven. Meanwhile the goddess fetched\r\nme up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea, all of them just\r\nskinned, for she meant playing a trick upon her father. Then she dug\r\nfour pits for us to lie in, and sat down to wait till we should come up.\r\nWhen we were close to her, she made us lie down in the pits one after\r\nthe other, and threw a seal skin over each of us. Our ambuscade would\r\nhave been intolerable, for the stench of the fishy seals was most\r\ndistressing {45}--who would go to bed with a sea monster if he could\r\nhelp it?--but here, too, the goddess helped us, and thought of something\r\nthat gave us great relief, for she put some ambrosia under each man's\r\nnostrils, which was so fragrant that it killed the smell of the seals.\r\n{46}", "\"We waited the whole morning and made the best of it, watching the seals\r\ncome up in hundreds to bask upon the sea shore, till at noon the old man\r\nof the sea came up too, and when he had found his fat seals he went over\r\nthem and counted them. We were among the first he counted, and he never\r\nsuspected any guile, but laid himself down to sleep as soon as he had\r\ndone counting. Then we rushed upon him with a shout and seized him; on\r\nwhich he began at once with his old tricks, and changed himself first\r\ninto a lion with a great mane; then all of a sudden he became a dragon,\r\na leopard, a wild boar; the next moment he was running water, and then\r\nagain directly he was a tree, but we stuck to him and never lost hold,\r\ntill at last the cunning old creature became distressed, and said,\r\n'Which of the gods was it, Son of Atreus, that hatched this plot with\r\nyou for snaring me and seizing me against my will? What do you want?'", "\"'You know that yourself, old man,' I answered, 'you will gain nothing\r\nby trying to put me off. It is because I have been kept so long in this\r\nisland, and see no sign of my being able to get away. I am losing\r\nall heart; tell me, then, for you gods know everything, which of the\r\nimmortals it is that is hindering me, and tell me also how I may sail\r\nthe sea so as to reach my home?'", "\"Then,' he said, 'if you would finish your voyage and get home quickly,\r\nyou must offer sacrifices to Jove and to the rest of the gods before\r\nembarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back to your\r\nfriends, and to your own house, till you have returned to the heaven-fed\r\nstream of Egypt, and offered holy hecatombs to the immortal gods that\r\nreign in heaven. When you have done this they will let you finish your\r\nvoyage.'", "\"I was broken hearted when I heard that I must go back all that long and\r\nterrible voyage to Egypt; {47} nevertheless, I answered, 'I will do all,\r\nold man, that you have laid upon me; but now tell me, and tell me true,\r\nwhether all the Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us when we set\r\nsail from Troy have got home safely, or whether any one of them came\r\nto a bad end either on board his own ship or among his friends when the\r\ndays of his fighting were done.'", "\"'Son of Atreus,' he answered, 'why ask me? You had better not know what\r\nI can tell you, for your eyes will surely fill when you have heard my\r\nstory. Many of those about whom you ask are dead and gone, but many\r\nstill remain, and only two of the chief men among the Achaeans\r\nperished during their return home. As for what happened on the field of\r\nbattle--you were there yourself. A third Achaean leader is still at sea,\r\nalive, but hindered from returning. Ajax was wrecked, for Neptune drove\r\nhim on to the great rocks of Gyrae; nevertheless, he let him get safe\r\nout of the water, and in spite of all Minerva's hatred he would have\r\nescaped death, if he had not ruined himself by boasting. He said the\r\ngods could not drown him even though they had tried to do so, and when\r\nNeptune heard this large talk, he seized his trident in his two brawny\r\nhands, and split the rock of Gyrae in two pieces. The base remained\r\nwhere it was, but the part on which Ajax was sitting fell headlong\r\ninto the sea and carried Ajax with it; so he drank salt water and was\r\ndrowned.", "\"'Your brother and his ships escaped, for Juno protected him, but when\r\nhe was just about to reach the high promontory of Malea, he was caught\r\nby a heavy gale which carried him out to sea again sorely against his\r\nwill, and drove him to the foreland where Thyestes used to dwell, but\r\nwhere Aegisthus was then living. By and by, however, it seemed as though\r\nhe was to return safely after all, for the gods backed the wind into its\r\nold quarter and they reached home; whereon Agamemnon kissed his native\r\nsoil, and shed tears of joy at finding himself in his own country.", "\"'Now there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept always on the watch, and\r\nto whom he had promised two talents of gold. This man had been looking\r\nout for a whole year to make sure that Agamemnon did not give him the\r\nslip and prepare war; when, therefore, this man saw Agamemnon go by,\r\nhe went and told Aegisthus, who at once began to lay a plot for him. He\r\npicked twenty of his bravest warriors and placed them in ambuscade on\r\none side the cloister, while on the opposite side he prepared a banquet.\r\nThen he sent his chariots and horsemen to Agamemnon, and invited him to\r\nthe feast, but he meant foul play. He got him there, all unsuspicious of\r\nthe doom that was awaiting him, and killed him when the banquet was\r\nover as though he were butchering an ox in the shambles; not one of\r\nAgamemnon's followers was left alive, nor yet one of Aegisthus', but\r\nthey were all killed there in the cloisters.'", "\"Thus spoke Proteus, and I was broken hearted as I heard him. I sat down\r\nupon the sands and wept; I felt as though I could no longer bear to live\r\nnor look upon the light of the sun. Presently, when I had had my fill of\r\nweeping and writhing upon the ground, the old man of the sea said, 'Son\r\nof Atreus, do not waste any more time in crying so bitterly; it can\r\ndo no manner of good; find your way home as fast as ever you can,\r\nfor Aegisthus may be still alive, and even though Orestes has been\r\nbeforehand with you in killing him, you may yet come in for his\r\nfuneral.'", "\"On this I took comfort in spite of all my sorrow, and said, 'I know,\r\nthen, about these two; tell me, therefore, about the third man of whom\r\nyou spoke; is he still alive, but at sea, and unable to get home? or is\r\nhe dead? Tell me, no matter how much it may grieve me.'", "\"'The third man,' he answered, 'is Ulysses who dwells in Ithaca. I\r\ncan see him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph\r\nCalypso, who is keeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach his home for\r\nhe has no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea. As for your own\r\nend, Menelaus, you shall not die in Argos, but the gods will take you to\r\nthe Elysian plain, which is at the ends of the world. There fair-haired\r\nRhadamanthus reigns, and men lead an easier life than any where else in\r\nthe world, for in Elysium there falls not rain, nor hail, nor snow, but\r\nOceanus breathes ever with a West wind that sings softly from the sea,\r\nand gives fresh life to all men. This will happen to you because you\r\nhave married Helen, and are Jove's son-in-law.'", "\"As he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the\r\nships with my companions, and my heart was clouded with care as I went\r\nalong.

When the child of morning,\r\nrosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we drew our ships into the water, and put\r\nour masts and sails within them; then we went on board ourselves, took\r\nour seats on the benches, and smote the grey sea with our oars. I\r\nagain stationed my ships in the heaven-fed stream of Egypt, and offered\r\nhecatombs that were full and sufficient.

He\r\nflew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at last he got to the\r\nisland which was his journey's end, he left the sea and went on by land\r\ntill he came to the cave where the nymph Calypso lived.", "He found her at home. There was a large fire burning on the hearth, and\r\none could smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and sandal\r\nwood. As for herself, she was busy at her loom, shooting her golden\r\nshuttle through the warp and singing beautifully. Round her cave there\r\nwas a thick wood of alder, poplar, and sweet smelling cypress trees,\r\nwherein all kinds of great birds had built their nests--owls, hawks, and\r\nchattering sea-crows that occupy their business in the waters. A vine\r\nloaded with grapes was trained and grew luxuriantly about the mouth of\r\nthe cave; there were also four running rills of water in channels cut\r\npretty close together, and turned hither and thither so as to irrigate\r\nthe beds of violets and luscious herbage over which they flowed. {51}\r\nEven a god could not help being charmed with such a lovely spot,\r\nso Mercury stood still and looked at it; but when he had admired it\r\nsufficiently he went inside the cave.", "Calypso knew him at once--for the gods all know each other, no matter\r\nhow far they live from one another--but Ulysses was not within; he was\r\non the sea-shore as usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with tears\r\nin his eyes, groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow.

As for\r\nthe day time, he spent it on the rocks and on the sea shore, weeping,\r\ncrying aloud for his despair, and always looking out upon the sea.\r\nCalypso then went close up to him said:", "%(dialogue)s", "Ulysses shuddered as he heard her. %(dialogue)s he answered, %(dialogue)s", "Calypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: %(dialogue)s said she, %(dialogue)s", "When she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, and Ulysses\r\nfollowed in her steps; so the pair, goddess and man, went on and on till\r\nthey came to Calypso's cave, where Ulysses took the seat that Mercury\r\nhad just left. Calypso set meat and drink before him of the food that\r\nmortals eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectar for herself, and\r\nthey laid their hands on the good things that were before them.

She at once set herself to think how\r\nshe could speed Ulysses on his way. So she gave him a great bronze\r\naxe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides, and had a\r\nbeautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on to it. She also gave him a\r\nsharp adze, and then led the way to the far end of the island where the\r\nlargest trees grew--alder, poplar and pine, that reached the sky--very\r\ndry and well seasoned, so as to sail light for him in the water. {53}\r\nThen, when she had shown him where the best trees grew, Calypso went\r\nhome, leaving him to cut them, which he soon finished doing. He cut down\r\ntwenty trees in all and adzed them smooth, squaring them by rule in good\r\nworkmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Calypso came back with some augers, so\r\nhe bored holes with them and fitted the timbers together with bolts and\r\nrivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled shipwright makes the beam\r\nof a large vessel, and he fixed a deck on top of the ribs, and ran a\r\ngunwale all round it. He also made a mast with a yard arm, and a rudder\r\nto steer with. He fenced the raft all round with wicker hurdles as a\r\nprotection against the waves, and then he threw on a quantity of wood.\r\nBy and by Calypso brought him some linen to make the sails, and he made\r\nthese too, excellently, making them fast with braces and sheets. Last of\r\nall, with the help of levers, he drew the raft down into the water.", "In four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifth Calypso\r\nsent him from the island after washing him and giving him some clean\r\nclothes. She gave him a goat skin full of black wine, and another larger\r\none of water; she also gave him a wallet full of provisions, and found\r\nhim in much good meat. Moreover, she made the wind fair and warm for\r\nhim, and gladly did Ulysses spread his sail before it, while he sat and\r\nguided the raft skilfully by means of the rudder. He never closed his\r\neyes, but kept them fixed on the Pleiads, on late-setting Bootes, and on\r\nthe Bear--which men also call the wain, and which turns round and round\r\nwhere it is, facing Orion, and alone never dipping into the stream of\r\nOceanus--for Calypso had told him to keep this to his left. Days seven\r\nand ten did he sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth the dim outlines\r\nof the mountains on the nearest part of the Phaeacian coast appeared,\r\nrising like a shield on the horizon.", "But King Neptune, who was returning from the Ethiopians, caught sight of\r\nUlysses a long way off, from the mountains of the Solymi. He could see\r\nhim sailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry, so he wagged his\r\nhead and muttered to himself, saying, %(dialogue)s", "Thereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident, stirred\r\nit round in the sea, and roused the rage of every wind that blows till\r\nearth, sea, and sky were hidden in cloud, and night sprang forth out of\r\nthe heavens. Winds from East, South, North, and West fell upon him all\r\nat the same time, and a tremendous sea got up, so that Ulysses' heart\r\nbegan to fail him. %(dialogue)s he said to himself in his dismay, %(dialogue)s", "As he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the raft\r\nreeled again, and he was carried overboard a long way off. He let go the\r\nhelm, and the force of the hurricane was so great that it broke the mast\r\nhalf way up, and both sail and yard went over into the sea. For a long\r\ntime Ulysses was under water, and it was all he could do to rise to the\r\nsurface again, for the clothes Calypso had given him weighed him down;\r\nbut at last he got his head above water and spat out the bitter brine\r\nthat was running down his face in streams. In spite of all this,\r\nhowever, he did not lose sight of his raft, but swam as fast as he could\r\ntowards it, got hold of it, and climbed on board again so as to escape\r\ndrowning. The sea took the raft and tossed it about as Autumn winds\r\nwhirl thistledown round and round upon a road. It was as though the\r\nSouth, North, East, and West winds were all playing battledore and\r\nshuttlecock with it at once.", "When he was in this plight, Ino daughter of Cadmus, also called\r\nLeucothea, saw him. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had been\r\nsince raised to the rank of a marine goddess. Seeing in what great\r\ndistress Ulysses now was, she had compassion upon him, and, rising like\r\na sea-gull from the waves, took her seat upon the raft.", "%(dialogue)s said she, %(dialogue)s With these\r\nwords she took off her veil and gave it him. Then she dived down again\r\nlike a sea-gull and vanished beneath the dark blue waters.", "But Ulysses did not know what to think. %(dialogue)s he said to himself in\r\nhis dismay, %(dialogue)s", "While he was thus in two minds, Neptune sent a terrible great wave that\r\nseemed to rear itself above his head till it broke right over the raft,\r\nwhich then went to pieces as though it were a heap of dry chaff tossed\r\nabout by a whirlwind. Ulysses got astride of one plank and rode upon\r\nit as if he were on horseback; he then took off the clothes Calypso\r\nhad given him, bound Ino's veil under his arms, and plunged into the\r\nsea--meaning to swim on shore. King Neptune watched him as he did so,\r\nand wagged his head, muttering to himself and saying, %(dialogue)s On this he lashed his horses and drove to Aegae where his\r\npalace is.", "But Minerva resolved to help Ulysses, so she bound the ways of all the\r\nwinds except one, and made them lie quite still; but she roused a good\r\nstiff breeze from the North that should lay the waters till Ulysses\r\nreached the land of the Phaeacians where he would be safe.", "Thereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water, with\r\na heavy swell on the sea and death staring him in the face; but when the\r\nthird day broke, the wind fell and there was a dead calm without so much\r\nas a breath of air stirring. As he rose on the swell he looked eagerly\r\nahead, and could see land quite near. Then, as children rejoice when\r\ntheir dear father begins to get better after having for a long time\r\nborne sore affliction sent him by some angry spirit, but the gods\r\ndeliver him from evil, so was Ulysses thankful when he again saw land\r\nand trees, and swam on with all his strength that he might once more set\r\nfoot upon dry ground. When, however, he got within earshot, he began to\r\nhear the surf thundering up against the rocks, for the swell still broke\r\nagainst them with a terrific roar. Everything was enveloped in spray;\r\nthere were no harbours where a ship might ride, nor shelter of any kind,\r\nbut only headlands, low-lying rocks, and mountain tops.", "Ulysses' heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly to\r\nhimself, %(dialogue)s", "While he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with such\r\nforce against the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn to\r\npieces if Minerva had not shown him what to do. He caught hold of the\r\nrock with both hands and clung to it groaning with pain till the wave\r\nretired, so he was saved that time; but presently the wave came on again\r\nand carried him back with it far into the sea--tearing his hands as the\r\nsuckers of a polypus are torn when some one plucks it from its bed, and\r\nthe stones come up along with it--even so did the rocks tear the skin\r\nfrom his strong hands, and then the wave drew him deep down under the\r\nwater.", "Here poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of his own\r\ndestiny, if Minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about him. He\r\nswam seaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating against\r\nthe land, and at the same time he kept looking towards the shore to\r\nsee if he could find some haven, or a spit that should take the waves\r\naslant. By and by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth of a river, and\r\nhere he thought would be the best place, for there were no rocks, and it\r\nafforded shelter from the wind. He felt that there was a current, so he\r\nprayed inwardly and said:", "%(dialogue)s", "Then the god staid his stream and stilled the waves, making all calm\r\nbefore him, and bringing him safely into the mouth of the river. Here\r\nat last Ulysses' knees and strong hands failed him, for the sea had\r\ncompletely broken him. His body was all swollen, and his mouth and\r\nnostrils ran down like a river with sea-water, so that he could neither\r\nbreathe nor speak, and lay swooning from sheer exhaustion; presently,\r\nwhen he had got his breath and came to himself again, he took off the\r\nscarf that Ino had given him and threw it back into the salt {54} stream\r\nof the river, whereon Ino received it into her hands from the wave that\r\nbore it towards her. Then he left the river, laid himself down among the\r\nrushes, and kissed the bounteous earth.", "%(dialogue)s he cried to himself in his dismay, %(dialogue)s", "In the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he found one\r\nupon some high ground not far from the water. There he crept beneath\r\ntwo shoots of olive that grew from a single stock--the one an ungrafted\r\nsucker, while the other had been grafted. No wind, however squally,\r\ncould break through the cover they afforded, nor could the sun's rays\r\npierce them, nor the rain get through them, so closely did they grow\r\ninto one another. Ulysses crept under these and began to make himself\r\na bed to lie on, for there was a great litter of dead leaves lying\r\nabout--enough to make a covering for two or three men even in hard\r\nwinter weather. He was glad enough to see this, so he laid himself down\r\nand heaped the leaves all round him. Then, as one who lives alone in the\r\ncountry, far from any neighbor, hides a brand as fire-seed in the\r\nashes to save himself from having to get a light elsewhere, even so did\r\nUlysses cover himself up with leaves; and Minerva shed a sweet sleep\r\nupon his eyes, closed his eyelids, and made him lose all memories of his\r\nsorrows.", "\r\nBook VI", "THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.", "So here Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva went off\r\nto the country and city of the Phaeacians--a people who used to live in\r\nthe fair town of Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes\r\nwere stronger than they and plundered them, so their king Nausithous\r\nmoved them thence and settled them in Scheria, far from all other\r\npeople. He surrounded the city with a wall, built houses and temples,\r\nand divided the lands among his people; but he was dead and gone to\r\nthe house of Hades, and King Alcinous, whose counsels were inspired\r\nof heaven, was now reigning. To his house, then, did Minerva hie in\r\nfurtherance of the return of Ulysses.", "She went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there\r\nslept a girl who was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa, daughter to King\r\nAlcinous. Two maid servants were sleeping near her, both very pretty,\r\none on either side of the doorway, which was closed with well made\r\nfolding doors. Minerva took the form of the famous sea captain Dymas's\r\ndaughter, who was a bosom friend of Nausicaa and just her own age; then,\r\ncoming up to the girl's bedside like a breath of wind, she hovered over\r\nher head and said:", "%(dialogue)s", "When she had said this Minerva went away to Olympus, which they say\r\nis the everlasting home of the gods.

This was the place to which the goddess\r\nwent when she had given instructions to the girl.", "By and by morning came and woke Nausicaa, who began wondering about\r\nher dream; she therefore went to the other end of the house to tell her\r\nfather and mother all about it, and found them in their own room. Her\r\nmother was sitting by the fireside spinning her purple yarn with her\r\nmaids around her, and she happened to catch her father just as he was\r\ngoing out to attend a meeting of the town council, which the Phaeacian\r\naldermen had convened. She stopped him and said:", "%(dialogue)s", "She did not say a word about her own wedding, for she did not like to,\r\nbut her father knew and said, %(dialogue)s", "On this he gave his orders to the servants, who got the waggon out,\r\nharnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl brought the clothes\r\ndown from the linen room and placed them on the waggon. Her mother\r\nprepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts of good things, and a\r\ngoat skin full of wine; the girl now got into the waggon, and her mother\r\ngave her also a golden cruse of oil, that she and her women might anoint\r\nthemselves. Then she took the whip and reins and lashed the mules on,\r\nwhereon they set off, and their hoofs clattered on the road. They pulled\r\nwithout flagging, and carried not only Nausicaa and her wash of clothes,\r\nbut the maids also who were with her.", "When they reached the water side they went to the washing cisterns,\r\nthrough which there ran at all times enough pure water to wash any\r\nquantity of linen, no matter how dirty. Here they unharnessed the mules\r\nand turned them out to feed on the sweet juicy herbage that grew by the\r\nwater side. They took the clothes out of the waggon, put them in the\r\nwater, and vied with one another in treading them in the pits to get the\r\ndirt out. After they had washed them and got them quite clean, they laid\r\nthem out by the sea side, where the waves had raised a high beach of\r\nshingle, and set about washing themselves and anointing themselves with\r\nolive oil. Then they got their dinner by the side of the stream, and\r\nwaited for the sun to finish drying the clothes. When they had done\r\ndinner they threw off the veils that covered their heads and began to\r\nplay at ball, while Nausicaa sang for them. As the huntress Diana goes\r\nforth upon the mountains of Taygetus or Erymanthus to hunt wild boars or\r\ndeer, and the wood nymphs, daughters of Aegis-bearing Jove, take their\r\nsport along with her (then is Leto proud at seeing her daughter stand a\r\nfull head taller than the others, and eclipse the loveliest amid a whole\r\nbevy of beauties), even so did the girl outshine her handmaids.", "When it was time for them to start home, and they were folding the\r\nclothes and putting them into the waggon, Minerva began to consider how\r\nUlysses should wake up and see the handsome girl who was to conduct him\r\nto the city of the Phaeacians. The girl, therefore, threw a ball at one\r\nof the maids, which missed her and fell into deep water. On this they\r\nall shouted, and the noise they made woke Ulysses, who sat up in his bed\r\nof leaves and began to wonder what it might all be.", "%(dialogue)s said he to himself, %(dialogue)s", "As he said this he crept from under his bush, and broke off a bough\r\ncovered with thick leaves to hide his nakedness. He looked like some\r\nlion of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in his strength and\r\ndefying both wind and rain; his eyes glare as he prowls in quest of\r\noxen, sheep, or deer, for he is famished, and will dare break even\r\ninto a well fenced homestead, trying to get at the sheep--even such did\r\nUlysses seem to the young women, as he drew near to them all naked as he\r\nwas, for he was in great want. On seeing one so unkempt and so begrimed\r\nwith salt water, the others scampered off along the spits that jutted\r\nout into the sea, but the daughter of Alcinous stood firm, for Minerva\r\nput courage into her heart and took away all fear from her. She stood\r\nright in front of Ulysses, and he doubted whether he should go up to\r\nher, throw himself at her feet, and embrace her knees as a suppliant, or\r\nstay where he was and entreat her to give him some clothes and show him\r\nthe way to the town. In the end he deemed it best to entreat her from a\r\ndistance in case the girl should take offence at his coming near enough\r\nto clasp her knees, so he addressed her in honeyed and persuasive\r\nlanguage.", "%(dialogue)s he said, \"I implore your aid--but tell me, are you a goddess\r\nor are you a mortal woman?

I never yet saw any\r\none so beautiful, neither man nor woman, and am lost in admiration as I\r\nbehold you. I can only compare you to a young palm tree which I saw when\r\nI was at Delos growing near the altar of Apollo--for I was there, too,\r\nwith much people after me, when I was on that journey which has been the\r\nsource of all my troubles. Never yet did such a young plant shoot out\r\nof the ground as that was, and I admired and wondered at it exactly as I\r\nnow admire and wonder at yourself. I dare not clasp your knees, but I\r\nam in great distress; yesterday made the twentieth day that I had been\r\ntossing about upon the sea. The winds and waves have taken me all the\r\nway from the Ogygian island, {55} and now fate has flung me upon this\r\ncoast that I may endure still further suffering; for I do not think that\r\nI have yet come to the end of it, but rather that heaven has still much\r\nevil in store for me.", "%(dialogue)s", "To this Nausicaa answered, %(dialogue)s", "Then she called her maids and said, %(dialogue)s", "On this the maids left off running away and began calling one another\r\nback.

When he had thoroughly washed himself, and had\r\ngot the brine out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil, and put\r\non the clothes which the girl had given him; Minerva then made him look\r\ntaller and stronger than before, she also made the hair grow thick on\r\nthe top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms; she\r\nglorified him about the head and shoulders as a skilful workman who has\r\nstudied art of all kinds under Vulcan and Minerva enriches a piece of\r\nsilver plate by gilding it--and his work is full of beauty. Then he went\r\nand sat down a little way off upon the beach, looking quite young and\r\nhandsome, and the girl gazed on him with admiration; then she said to\r\nher maids:", "%(dialogue)s", "They did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, who ate and\r\ndrank ravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind.\r\nMeanwhile, Nausicaa bethought her of another matter.

As long as\r\nwe are going past the fields and farm lands, follow briskly behind the\r\nwaggon along with the maids and I will lead the way myself. Presently,\r\nhowever, we shall come to the town, where you will find a high wall\r\nrunning all round it, and a good harbour on either side with a narrow\r\nentrance into the city, and the ships will be drawn up by the road side,\r\nfor every one has a place where his own ship can lie. You will see the\r\nmarket place with a temple of Neptune in the middle of it, and paved\r\nwith large stones bedded in the earth. Here people deal in ship's gear\r\nof all kinds, such as cables and sails, and here, too, are the places\r\nwhere oars are made, for the Phaeacians are not a nation of archers;\r\nthey know nothing about bows and arrows, but are a sea-faring folk, and\r\npride themselves on their masts, oars, and ships, with which they travel\r\nfar over the sea.", "\"I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against\r\nme later on; for the people here are very ill-natured, and some low\r\nfellow, if he met us, might say, 'Who is this fine-looking stranger that\r\nis going about with Nausicaa? Where did she find him? I suppose she is\r\ngoing to marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor whom she has taken\r\nfrom some foreign vessel, for we have no neighbours; or some god has at\r\nlast come down from heaven in answer to her prayers, and she is going to\r\nlive with him all the rest of her life. It would be a good thing if she\r\nwould take herself off and find a husband somewhere else, for she will\r\nnot look at one of the many excellent young Phaeacians who are in love\r\nwith her.' This is the kind of disparaging remark that would be made\r\nabout me, and I could not complain, for I should myself be scandalised\r\nat seeing any other girl do the like, and go about with men in spite\r\nof everybody, while her father and mother were still alive, and without\r\nhaving been married in the face of all the world.", "%(dialogue)s", "So saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the river.\r\nThe mules drew well, and their hoofs went up and down upon the road.\r\nShe was careful not to go too fast for Ulysses and the maids who were\r\nfollowing on foot along with the waggon, so she plied her whip with\r\njudgement.

This old woman had been brought by sea from Apeira,\r\nand had been chosen as a prize for Alcinous because he was king over the\r\nPhaeacians, and the people obeyed him as though he were a god. {57}\r\nShe had been nurse to Nausicaa, and had now lit the fire for her, and\r\nbrought her supper for her into her own room.", "Presently Ulysses got up to go towards the town; and Minerva shed a\r\nthick mist all round him to hide him in case any of the proud Phaeacians\r\nwho met him should be rude to him, or ask him who he was.

He admired their\r\nharbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of the city,\r\nwhich, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking, and when\r\nthey reached the king's house Minerva said:", "\"This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show you.\r\nYou will find a number of great people sitting at table, but do not be\r\nafraid; go straight in, for the bolder a man is the more likely he is to\r\ncarry his point, even though he is a stranger. First find the queen. Her\r\nname is Arete, and she comes of the same family as her husband Alcinous.\r\nThey both descend originally from Neptune, who was father to Nausithous\r\nby Periboea, a woman of great beauty.

She went to\r\nMarathon {59} and to the spacious streets of Athens, where she entered\r\nthe abode of Erechtheus; but Ulysses went on to the house of Alcinous,\r\nand he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the threshold\r\nof bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that of the sun or\r\nmoon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end to end, and the\r\ncornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and hung on pillars of\r\nsilver that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel was silver and\r\nthe hook of the door was of gold.", "On either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan, with\r\nhis consummate skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watch over the\r\npalace of king Alcinous; so they were immortal and could never grow old.\r\nSeats were ranged all along the wall, here and there from one end to the\r\nother, with coverings of fine woven work which the women of the house\r\nhad made. Here the chief persons of the Phaeacians used to sit and eat\r\nand drink, for there was abundance at all seasons; and there were golden\r\nfigures of young men with lighted torches in their hands, raised on\r\npedestals, to give light by night to those who were at table. There are\r\n{60} fifty maid servants in the house, some of whom are always grinding\r\nrich yellow grain at the mill, while others work at the loom, or sit and\r\nspin, and their shuttles go backwards and forwards like the fluttering\r\nof aspen leaves, while the linen is so closely woven that it will turn\r\noil. As the Phaeacians are the best sailors in the world, so their women\r\nexcel all others in weaving, for Minerva has taught them all manner of\r\nuseful arts, and they are very intelligent.", "Outside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of\r\nabout four acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful\r\ntrees--pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are\r\nluscious figs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor\r\nfail all the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so\r\nsoft that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on\r\npear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the grapes, for\r\nthere is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this,\r\nthe grapes are being made into raisins; in another part they are being\r\ngathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further on\r\nhave shed their blossom and are beginning to show fruit, others again\r\nare just changing colour. In the furthest part of the ground there are\r\nbeautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all the year\r\nround. Two streams go through it, the one turned in ducts throughout the\r\nwhole garden, while the other is carried under the ground of the outer\r\ncourt to the house itself, and the town's people draw water from it.\r\nSuch, then, were the splendours with which the gods had endowed the\r\nhouse of king Alcinous.", "So here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when he\r\nhad looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the\r\nprecincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among the\r\nPhaeacians making their drink offerings to Mercury, which they always\r\ndid the last thing before going away for the night. {61} He went\r\nstraight through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness\r\nin which Minerva had enveloped him, till he reached Arete and King\r\nAlcinous; then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and at\r\nthat moment the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became\r\nvisible. Every one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there,\r\nbut Ulysses began at once with his petition.", "%(dialogue)s he exclaimed, %(dialogue)s", "Then he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their\r\npeace, till presently the old hero Echeneus, who was an excellent\r\nspeaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty\r\naddressed them thus:", "%(dialogue)s said he, %(dialogue)s", "When Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised him from\r\nthe hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, who had been sitting\r\nbeside him, and was his favourite son. A maid servant then brought him\r\nwater in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for\r\nhim to wash his hands, and she drew a clean table beside him; an upper\r\nservant brought him bread and offered him many good things of what there\r\nwas in the house, and Ulysses ate and drank.

Arete was the first to speak,\r\nfor she recognised the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that Ulysses\r\nwas wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so she said,\r\n%(dialogue)s", "And Ulysses answered, \"It would be a long story Madam, were I to relate\r\nin full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been laid\r\nheavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an island far away\r\nin the sea which is called 'the Ogygian.' Here dwells the cunning and\r\npowerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas. She lives by herself far\r\nfrom all neighbours human or divine. Fortune, however, brought me to\r\nher hearth all desolate and alone, for Jove struck my ship with his\r\nthunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave comrades were\r\ndrowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and was carried\r\nhither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last during the\r\ndarkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the Ogygian island\r\nwhere the great goddess Calypso lives. She took me in and treated me\r\nwith the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make me immortal that I\r\nmight never grow old, but she could not persuade me to let her do so.", "\"I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the good\r\nclothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at last\r\nwhen the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free will,\r\neither because Jove had told her she must, or because she had changed\r\nher mind. She sent me from her island on a raft, which she provisioned\r\nwith abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave me good stout\r\nclothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm and fair. Days seven\r\nand ten did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth I caught sight of\r\nthe first outlines of the mountains upon your coast--and glad indeed was\r\nI to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still much trouble in\r\nstore for me, for at this point Neptune would let me go no further, and\r\nraised a great storm against me; the sea was so terribly high that I\r\ncould no longer keep to my raft, which went to pieces under the fury of\r\nthe gale, and I had to swim for it, till wind and current brought me to\r\nyour shores.", "%(dialogue)s", "Then Alcinous said, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Ulysses; %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Alcinous, %(dialogue)s", "Then was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, %(dialogue)s", "Thus did they converse.

The fifty-two picked oarsmen went to\r\nthe sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they drew\r\nthe ship into the water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound\r\nthe oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in due\r\ncourse, and spread the white sails aloft. They moored the vessel a\r\nlittle way out from land, and then came on shore and went to the house\r\nof King Alcinous. The out houses, {66} yards, and all the precincts were\r\nfilled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young; and\r\nAlcinous killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and two oxen.\r\nThese they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent banquet.", "A servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the muse had\r\ndearly loved, but to whom she had given both good and evil, for though\r\nshe had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she had robbed him of\r\nhis eyesight. Pontonous set a seat for him among the guests, leaning it\r\nup against a bearing-post. He hung the lyre for him on a peg over his\r\nhead, and showed him where he was to feel for it with his hands. He also\r\nset a fair table with a basket of victuals by his side, and a cup of\r\nwine from which he might drink whenever he was so disposed.", "The company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before\r\nthem, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, the muse\r\ninspired Demodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more especially\r\na matter that was then in the mouths of all men, to wit, the quarrel\r\nbetween Ulysses and Achilles, and the fierce words that they heaped on\r\none another as they sat together at a banquet. But Agamemnon was glad\r\nwhen he heard his chieftains quarrelling with one another, for Apollo\r\nhad foretold him this at Pytho when he crossed the stone floor to\r\nconsult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the evil that by the will\r\nof Jove fell both upon Danaans and Trojans.", "Thus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head and\r\ncovered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see that he\r\nwas weeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears from his\r\neyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a drink-offering to\r\nthe gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus to sing further, for\r\nthey delighted in his lays, then Ulysses again drew his mantle over his\r\nhead and wept bitterly. No one noticed his distress except Alcinous, who\r\nwas sitting near him, and heard the heavy sighs that he was heaving. So\r\nhe at once said, %(dialogue)s", "With these words he led the way, and the others followed after. A\r\nservant hung Demodocus's lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the\r\ncloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all the chief\r\nmen of the Phaeacians were going to see the sports; a crowd of several\r\nthousands of people followed them, and there were many excellent\r\ncompetitors for all the prizes. Acroneos, Ocyalus, Elatreus, Nauteus,\r\nPrymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon, Anabesineus, and\r\nAmphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was also Euryalus son of\r\nNaubolus, who was like Mars himself, and was the best looking man\r\namong the Phaeacians except Laodamas. Three sons of Alcinous, Laodamas,\r\nHalios, and Clytoneus, competed also.", "The foot races came first. The course was set out for them from the\r\nstarting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew\r\nforward at the same moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way; he\r\nleft every one else behind him by the length of the furrow that a couple\r\nof mules can plough in a fallow field. {67} They then turned to the\r\npainful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved to be the best man.\r\nAmphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at throwing the disc\r\nthere was no one who could approach Elatreus. Alcinous's son Laodamas\r\nwas the best boxer, and he it was who presently said, when they had all\r\nbeen diverted with the games, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Euryalus, %(dialogue)s", "When Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the crowd\r\nand said to Ulysses, %(dialogue)s", "Ulysses answered, %(dialogue)s", "Then Euryalus reviled him outright and said, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s answered Ulysses, fiercely, %(dialogue)s", "So he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc,\r\nlarger, more massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians\r\nwhen disc-throwing among themselves. {68} Then, swinging it back, he\r\nthrew it from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as\r\nhe did so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight as\r\nit sped gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond any mark that had been\r\nmade yet. Minerva, in the form of a man, came and marked the place where\r\nit had fallen. %(dialogue)s said she, %(dialogue)s", "Ulysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on,\r\nso he began to speak more pleasantly. %(dialogue)s said he, %(dialogue)s", "They all held their peace except King Alcinous, who began, %(dialogue)s", "On this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king's house,\r\nand the nine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward. It was\r\ntheir business to manage everything connected with the sports, so\r\nthey made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers.\r\nPresently the servant came back with Demodocus's lyre, and he took his\r\nplace in the midst of them, whereon the best young dancers in the town\r\nbegan to foot and trip it so nimbly that Ulysses was delighted with the\r\nmerry twinkling of their feet.", "Meanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of Mars and Venus, and how\r\nthey first began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars made Venus\r\nmany presents, and defiled King Vulcan's marriage bed, so the sun, who\r\nsaw what they were about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry when he\r\nheard such dreadful news, so he went to his smithy brooding mischief,\r\ngot his great anvil into its place, and began to forge some chains which\r\nnone could either unloose or break, so that they might stay there in\r\nthat place. {69} When he had finished his snare he went into his bedroom\r\nand festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like cobwebs; he also\r\nlet many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling. Not even a god\r\ncould see them so fine and subtle were they. As soon as he had spread\r\nthe chains all over the bed, he made as though he were setting out for\r\nthe fair state of Lemnos, which of all places in the world was the one\r\nhe was most fond of. But Mars kept no blind look out, and as soon as he\r\nsaw him start, hurried off to his house, burning with love for Venus.", "Now Venus was just come in from a visit to her father Jove, and was\r\nabout sitting down when Mars came inside the house, and said as he took\r\nher hand in his own, %(dialogue)s", "She was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take their rest,\r\nwhereon they were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had spread\r\nfor them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found too\r\nlate that they were in a trap. Then Vulcan came up to them, for he had\r\nturned back before reaching Lemnos, when his scout the sun told him what\r\nwas going on. He was in a furious passion, and stood in the vestibule\r\nmaking a dreadful noise as he shouted to all the gods.", "%(dialogue)s he cried, %(dialogue)s", "On this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling\r\nNeptune came, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, but the\r\ngoddesses staid at home all of them for shame. Then the givers of all\r\ngood things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared with\r\ninextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning Vulcan had been,\r\nwhereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying:", "%(dialogue)s", "Thus did they converse, but King Apollo said to Mercury, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s answered Mercury, %(dialogue)s", "The immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but Neptune took\r\nit all seriously, and kept on imploring Vulcan to set Mars free again.\r\n%(dialogue)s he cried, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Vulcan, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s said Neptune, %(dialogue)s So Vulcan answered, %(dialogue)s", "Thereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they were\r\nfree they scampered off, Mars to Thrace and laughter-loving Venus to\r\nCyprus and to Paphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant with\r\nburnt offerings. Here the Graces bathed her, and anointed her with oil\r\nof ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of, and they clothed her\r\nin raiment of the most enchanting beauty.", "Thus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians were\r\ncharmed as they heard him.", "Then Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius to dance alone, for there was no\r\none to compete with them. So they took a red ball which Polybus had made\r\nfor them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw it up towards\r\nthe clouds, while the other jumped from off the ground and caught it\r\nwith ease before it came down again. When they had done throwing the\r\nball straight up into the air they began to dance, and at the same time\r\nkept on throwing it backwards and forwards to one another, while all\r\nthe young men in the ring applauded and made a great stamping with their\r\nfeet. Then Ulysses said:", "%(dialogue)s", "The king was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the Phaeacians,\r\n%(dialogue)s", "Thus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying, and\r\nsent their servants to fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said, %(dialogue)s", "As he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said, %(dialogue)s", "To which Ulysses answered, %(dialogue)s", "With these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards\r\nsundown the presents began to make their appearance, as the servants of\r\nthe donors kept bringing them to the house of King Alcinous; here his\r\nsons received them, and placed them under their mother's charge. Then\r\nAlcinous led the way to the house and bade his guests take their seats.", "%(dialogue)s said he, turning to Queen Arete, %(dialogue)s\r\n{70}", "Then Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as fast as\r\nthey could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to a clear\r\nfire; they threw on sticks to make it blaze, and the water became hot\r\nas the flame played about the belly of the tripod. {71} Meanwhile Arete\r\nbrought a magnificent chest from her own room, and inside it she packed\r\nall the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the Phaeacians had\r\nbrought. Lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt from Alcinous, and\r\nsaid to Ulysses:", "%(dialogue)s {72}", "When Ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast\r\nwith a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done so before an upper\r\nservant told him to come to the bath and wash himself. He was very glad\r\nof a warm bath, for he had had no one to wait upon him ever since he\r\nleft the house of Calypso, who as long as he remained with her had taken\r\nas good care of him as though he had been a god. When the servants had\r\ndone washing and anointing him with oil, and had given him a clean cloak\r\nand shirt, he left the bath room and joined the guests who were sitting\r\nover their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood by one of the bearing-posts\r\nsupporting the roof of the cloister, and admired him as she saw him\r\npass. %(dialogue)s said she, %(dialogue)s", "And Ulysses said, %(dialogue)s", "When he had said this, he seated himself beside Alcinous. Supper was\r\nthen served, and the wine was mixed for drinking. A servant led in the\r\nfavourite bard Demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company, near\r\none of the bearing-posts supporting the cloister, that he might lean\r\nagainst it. Then Ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork with plenty of\r\nfat (for there was abundance left on the joint) and said to a servant,\r\n%(dialogue)s", "The servant carried the pork in his fingers over to Demodocus, who took\r\nit and was very much pleased. They then laid their hands on the good\r\nthings that were before them, and as soon as they had had to eat and\r\ndrink, Ulysses said to Demodocus, %(dialogue)s", "The bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point where some of\r\nthe Argives set fire to their tents and sailed away while others, hidden\r\nwithin the horse, {73} were waiting with Ulysses in the Trojan place\r\nof assembly. For the Trojans themselves had drawn the horse into their\r\nfortress, and it stood there while they sat in council round it, and\r\nwere in three minds as to what they should do. Some were for breaking it\r\nup then and there; others would have it dragged to the top of the rock\r\non which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the precipice; while\r\nyet others were for letting it remain as an offering and propitiation\r\nfor the gods. And this was how they settled it in the end, for the city\r\nwas doomed when it took in that horse, within which were all the bravest\r\nof the Argives waiting to bring death and destruction on the Trojans.\r\nAnon he sang how the sons of the Achaeans issued from the horse, and\r\nsacked the town, breaking out from their ambuscade. He sang how they\r\noverran the city hither and thither and ravaged it, and how Ulysses went\r\nraging like Mars along with Menelaus to the house of Deiphobus. It was\r\nthere that the fight raged most furiously, nevertheless by Minerva's\r\nhelp he was victorious.", "All this he told, but Ulysses was overcome as he heard him, and his\r\ncheeks were wet with tears. He wept as a woman weeps when she throws\r\nherself on the body of her husband who has fallen before his own city\r\nand people, fighting bravely in defence of his home and children. She\r\nscreams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies gasping for\r\nbreath and dying, but her enemies beat her from behind about the back\r\nand shoulders, and carry her off into slavery, to a life of labour and\r\nsorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks--even so piteously did\r\nUlysses weep, but none of those present perceived his tears except\r\nAlcinous, who was sitting near him, and could hear the sobs and sighs\r\nthat he was heaving. The king, therefore, at once rose and said:", "\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, let Demodocus cease\r\nhis song, for there are those present who do not seem to like it. From\r\nthe moment that we had done supper and Demodocus began to sing, our\r\nguest has been all the time groaning and lamenting. He is evidently\r\nin great trouble, so let the bard leave off, that we may all enjoy\r\nourselves, hosts and guest alike. This will be much more as it should\r\nbe, for all these festivities, with the escort and the presents that we\r\nare making with so much good will are wholly in his honour, and any\r\none with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he ought to\r\ntreat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own brother.", "\"Therefore, Sir, do you on your part affect no more concealment nor\r\nreserve in the matter about which I shall ask you; it will be more\r\npolite in you to give me a plain answer; tell me the name by which your\r\nfather and mother over yonder used to call you, and by which you were\r\nknown among your neighbours and fellow-citizens. There is no one,\r\nneither rich nor poor, who is absolutely without any name whatever, for\r\npeople's fathers and mothers give them names as soon as they are born.\r\nTell me also your country, nation, and city, that our ships may shape\r\ntheir purpose accordingly and take you there. For the Phaeacians have\r\nno pilots; their vessels have no rudders as those of other nations have,\r\nbut the ships themselves understand what it is that we are thinking\r\nabout and want; they know all the cities and countries in the whole\r\nworld, and can traverse the sea just as well even when it is covered\r\nwith mist and cloud, so that there is no danger of being wrecked or\r\ncoming to any harm. Still I do remember hearing my father say that\r\nNeptune was angry with us for being too easy-going in the matter of\r\ngiving people escorts. He said that one of these days he should wreck a\r\nship of ours as it was returning from having escorted some one, {74} and\r\nbury our city under a high mountain. This is what my father used to say,\r\nbut whether the god will carry out his threat or no is a matter which he\r\nwill decide for himself.", "%(dialogue)s", "\r\nBook IX", "ULYSSES DECLARES HIMSELF AND BEGINS HIS STORY---THE CICONS, LOTOPHAGI,\r\nAND CYCLOPES.", "\r\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"King Alcinous, it is a good thing to hear a bard\r\nwith such a divine voice as this man has. There is nothing better or\r\nmore delightful than when a whole people make merry together, with the\r\nguests sitting orderly to listen, while the table is loaded with bread\r\nand meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills his cup for every\r\nman. This is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see. Now, however,\r\nsince you are inclined to ask the story of my sorrows, and rekindle my\r\nown sad memories in respect of them, I do not know how to begin, nor yet\r\nhow to continue and conclude my tale, for the hand of heaven has been\r\nlaid heavily upon me.", "\"Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you too may know it, and\r\none day, if I outlive this time of sorrow, may become my guests though I\r\nlive so far away from all of you. I am Ulysses son of Laertes, renowned\r\namong mankind for all manner of subtlety, so that my fame ascends to\r\nheaven. I live in Ithaca, where there is a high mountain called Neritum,\r\ncovered with forests; and not far from it there is a group of islands\r\nvery near to one another--Dulichium, Same, and the wooded island of\r\nZacynthus. It lies squat on the horizon, all highest up in the sea\r\ntowards the sunset, while the others lie away from it towards dawn. {75}\r\nIt is a rugged island, but it breeds brave men, and my eyes know none\r\nthat they better love to look upon. The goddess Calypso kept me with her\r\nin her cave, and wanted me to marry her, as did also the cunning Aeaean\r\ngoddess Circe; but they could neither of them persuade me, for there\r\nis nothing dearer to a man than his own country and his parents, and\r\nhowever splendid a home he may have in a foreign country, if it be far\r\nfrom father or mother, he does not care about it. Now, however, I will\r\ntell you of the many hazardous adventures which by Jove's will I met\r\nwith on my return from Troy.", "\"When I had set sail thence the wind took me first to Ismarus, which is\r\nthe city of the Cicons. There I sacked the town and put the people to\r\nthe sword. We took their wives and also much booty, which we divided\r\nequitably amongst us, so that none might have reason to complain. I\r\nthen said that we had better make off at once, but my men very foolishly\r\nwould not obey me, so they staid there drinking much wine and killing\r\ngreat numbers of sheep and oxen on the sea shore. Meanwhile the Cicons\r\ncried out for help to other Cicons who lived inland. These were more in\r\nnumber, and stronger, and they were more skilled in the art of war,\r\nfor they could fight, either from chariots or on foot as the occasion\r\nserved; in the morning, therefore, they came as thick as leaves and\r\nbloom in summer, and the hand of heaven was against us, so that we were\r\nhard pressed. They set the battle in array near the ships, and the hosts\r\naimed their bronze-shod spears at one another. {76} So long as the day\r\nwaxed and it was still morning, we held our own against them, though\r\nthey were more in number than we; but as the sun went down, towards the\r\ntime when men loose their oxen, the Cicons got the better of us, and we\r\nlost half a dozen men from every ship we had; so we got away with those\r\nthat were left.", "\"Thence we sailed onward with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have\r\nescaped death though we had lost our comrades, nor did we leave till we\r\nhad thrice invoked each one of the poor fellows who had perished by the\r\nhands of the Cicons. Then Jove raised the North wind against us till it\r\nblew a hurricane, so that land and sky were hidden in thick clouds, and\r\nnight sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the ships run before the\r\ngale, but the force of the wind tore our sails to tatters, so we took\r\nthem down for fear of shipwreck, and rowed our hardest towards the land.\r\nThere we lay two days and two nights suffering much alike from toil and\r\ndistress of mind, but on the morning of the third day we again raised\r\nour masts, set sail, and took our places, letting the wind and steersmen\r\ndirect our ship. I should have got home at that time unharmed had not\r\nthe North wind and the currents been against me as I was doubling Cape\r\nMalea, and set me off my course hard by the island of Cythera.", "\"I was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon the\r\nsea, but on the tenth day we reached the land of the Lotus-eaters, who\r\nlive on a food that comes from a kind of flower. Here we landed to take\r\nin fresh water, and our crews got their mid-day meal on the shore near\r\nthe ships. When they had eaten and drunk I sent two of my company to\r\nsee what manner of men the people of the place might be, and they had\r\na third man under them. They started at once, and went about among the\r\nLotus-eaters, who did them no hurt, but gave them to eat of the lotus,\r\nwhich was so delicious that those who ate of it left off caring about\r\nhome, and did not even want to go back and say what had happened to\r\nthem, but were for staying and munching lotus {77} with the Lotus-eaters\r\nwithout thinking further of their return; nevertheless, though they wept\r\nbitterly I forced them back to the ships and made them fast under the\r\nbenches. Then I told the rest to go on board at once, lest any of them\r\nshould taste of the lotus and leave off wanting to get home, so they\r\ntook their places and smote the grey sea with their oars.", "\"We sailed hence, always in much distress, till we came to the land of\r\nthe lawless and inhuman Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes neither plant nor\r\nplough, but trust in providence, and live on such wheat, barley, and\r\ngrapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage, and their wild grapes\r\nyield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them. They have no\r\nlaws nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves on the tops of\r\nhigh mountains; each is lord and master in his family, and they take no\r\naccount of their neighbours.", "\"Now off their harbour there lies a wooded and fertile island not quite\r\nclose to the land of the Cyclopes, but still not far. It is over-run\r\nwith wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and are never\r\ndisturbed by foot of man; for sportsmen--who as a rule will suffer so\r\nmuch hardship in forest or among mountain precipices--do not go there,\r\nnor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it lies a wilderness\r\nuntilled and unsown from year to year, and has no living thing upon it\r\nbut only goats. For the Cyclopes have no ships, nor yet shipwrights who\r\ncould make ships for them; they cannot therefore go from city to city,\r\nor sail over the sea to one another's country as people who have ships\r\ncan do; if they had had these they would have colonised the island, {78}\r\nfor it is a very good one, and would yield everything in due season.\r\nThere are meadows that in some places come right down to the sea\r\nshore, well watered and full of luscious grass; grapes would do there\r\nexcellently; there is level land for ploughing, and it would always\r\nyield heavily at harvest time, for the soil is deep. There is a good\r\nharbour where no cables are wanted, nor yet anchors, nor need a ship be\r\nmoored, but all one has to do is to beach one's vessel and stay there\r\ntill the wind becomes fair for putting out to sea again. At the head of\r\nthe harbour there is a spring of clear water coming out of a cave, and\r\nthere are poplars growing all round it.", "\"Here we entered, but so dark was the night that some god must have\r\nbrought us in, for there was nothing whatever to be seen. A thick mist\r\nhung all round our ships; {79} the moon was hidden behind a mass of\r\nclouds so that no one could have seen the island if he had looked for\r\nit, nor were there any breakers to tell us we were close in shore before\r\nwe found ourselves upon the land itself; when, however, we had beached\r\nthe ships, we took down the sails, went ashore and camped upon the beach\r\ntill daybreak.", "\"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we admired\r\nthe island and wandered all over it, while the nymphs Jove's daughters\r\nroused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner. On\r\nthis we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships, and\r\ndividing ourselves into three bands began to shoot the goats. Heaven\r\nsent us excellent sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each ship got\r\nnine goats, while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong day to\r\nthe going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill, and we had plenty\r\nof wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars full when we sacked\r\nthe city of the Cicons, and this had not yet run out. While we were\r\nfeasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land of the Cyclopes,\r\nwhich was hard by, and saw the smoke of their stubble fires. We could\r\nalmost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating of their sheep and\r\ngoats, but when the sun went down and it came on dark, we camped down\r\nupon the beach, and next morning I called a council.", "\"'Stay here, my brave fellows,' said I, 'all the rest of you, while I go\r\nwith my ship and exploit these people myself: I want to see if they are\r\nuncivilised savages, or a hospitable and humane race.'", "\"I went on board, bidding my men to do so also and loose the hawsers; so\r\nthey took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars. When we\r\ngot to the land, which was not far, there, on the face of a cliff near\r\nthe sea, we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. It was a station for\r\na great many sheep and goats, and outside there was a large yard, with\r\na high wall round it made of stones built into the ground and of trees\r\nboth pine and oak. This was the abode of a huge monster who was then\r\naway from home shepherding his flocks. He would have nothing to do with\r\nother people, but led the life of an outlaw. He was a horrid creature,\r\nnot like a human being at all, but resembling rather some crag that\r\nstands out boldly against the sky on the top of a high mountain.", "\"I told my men to draw the ship ashore, and stay where they were, all\r\nbut the twelve best among them, who were to go along with myself. I also\r\ntook a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me by Maron,\r\nson of Euanthes, who was priest of Apollo the patron god of Ismarus, and\r\nlived within the wooded precincts of the temple. When we were sacking\r\nthe city we respected him, and spared his life, as also his wife and\r\nchild; so he made me some presents of great value--seven talents of fine\r\ngold, and a bowl of silver, with twelve jars of sweet wine, unblended,\r\nand of the most exquisite flavour. Not a man nor maid in the house knew\r\nabout it, but only himself, his wife, and one housekeeper: when he drank\r\nit he mixed twenty parts of water to one of wine, and yet the fragrance\r\nfrom the mixing-bowl was so exquisite that it was impossible to refrain\r\nfrom drinking. I filled a large skin with this wine, and took a wallet\r\nfull of provisions with me, for my mind misgave me that I might have to\r\ndeal with some savage who would be of great strength, and would respect\r\nneither right nor law.", "\"We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we went inside\r\nand took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks were loaded\r\nwith cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens could hold.\r\nThey were kept in separate flocks; first there were the hoggets, then\r\nthe oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very young ones {80} all\r\nkept apart from one another; as for his dairy, all the vessels, bowls,\r\nand milk pails into which he milked, were swimming with whey. When they\r\nsaw all this, my men begged me to let them first steal some cheeses, and\r\nmake off with them to the ship; they would then return, drive down the\r\nlambs and kids, put them on board and sail away with them. It would have\r\nbeen indeed better if we had done so but I would not listen to them, for\r\nI wanted to see the owner himself, in the hope that he might give me\r\na present. When, however, we saw him my poor men found him ill to deal\r\nwith.", "\"We lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice, ate others\r\nof them, and then sat waiting till the Cyclops should come in with his\r\nsheep. When he came, he brought in with him a huge load of dry firewood\r\nto light the fire for his supper, and this he flung with such a noise on\r\nto the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for fear at the far end\r\nof the cavern. Meanwhile he drove all the ewes inside, as well as the\r\nshe-goats that he was going to milk, leaving the males, both rams and\r\nhe-goats, outside in the yards. Then he rolled a huge stone to the mouth\r\nof the cave--so huge that two and twenty strong four-wheeled waggons\r\nwould not be enough to draw it from its place against the doorway. When\r\nhe had so done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats, all in due\r\ncourse, and then let each of them have her own young. He curdled half\r\nthe milk and set it aside in wicker strainers, but the other half he\r\npoured into bowls that he might drink it for his supper. When he had got\r\nthrough with all his work, he lit the fire, and then caught sight of us,\r\nwhereon he said:", "\"'Strangers, who are you? Where do sail from? Are you traders, or do\r\nyou sail the sea as rovers, with your hands against every man, and every\r\nman's hand against you?'", "\"We were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and monstrous\r\nform, but I managed to say, 'We are Achaeans on our way home from Troy,\r\nbut by the will of Jove, and stress of weather, we have been driven far\r\nout of our course. We are the people of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, who\r\nhas won infinite renown throughout the whole world, by sacking so great\r\na city and killing so many people. We therefore humbly pray you to show\r\nus some hospitality, and otherwise make us such presents as visitors may\r\nreasonably expect. May your excellency fear the wrath of heaven, for we\r\nare your suppliants, and Jove takes all respectable travellers under his\r\nprotection, for he is the avenger of all suppliants and foreigners in\r\ndistress.'", "\"To this he gave me but a pitiless answer, 'Stranger,' said he, 'you are\r\na fool, or else you know nothing of this country. Talk to me, indeed,\r\nabout fearing the gods or shunning their anger? We Cyclopes do not care\r\nabout Jove or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever so much stronger\r\nthan they. I shall not spare either yourself or your companions out of\r\nany regard for Jove, unless I am in the humour for doing so. And now\r\ntell me where you made your ship fast when you came on shore. Was it\r\nround the point, or is she lying straight off the land?'", "\"He said this to draw me out, but I was too cunning to be caught in that\r\nway, so I answered with a lie; 'Neptune,' said I, 'sent my ship on to\r\nthe rocks at the far end of your country, and wrecked it. We were driven\r\non to them from the open sea, but I and those who are with me escaped\r\nthe jaws of death.'", "\"The cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer, but with a\r\nsudden clutch he gripped up two of my men at once and dashed them down\r\nupon the ground as though they had been puppies. Their brains were shed\r\nupon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood. Then he tore\r\nthem limb from limb and supped upon them. He gobbled them up like a lion\r\nin the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails, without leaving\r\nanything uneaten. As for us, we wept and lifted up our hands to heaven\r\non seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not know what else to do; but\r\nwhen the Cyclops had filled his huge paunch, and had washed down his\r\nmeal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk, he stretched himself\r\nfull length upon the ground among his sheep, and went to sleep. I was at\r\nfirst inclined to seize my sword, draw it, and drive it into his vitals,\r\nbut I reflected that if I did we should all certainly be lost, for we\r\nshould never be able to shift the stone which the monster had put in\r\nfront of the door. So we stayed sobbing and sighing where we were till\r\nmorning came.", "\"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, he again lit\r\nhis fire, milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and then let\r\neach have her own young one; as soon as he had got through with all his\r\nwork, he clutched up two more of my men, and began eating them for his\r\nmorning's meal. Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled the stone\r\naway from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once put it back\r\nagain--as easily as though he were merely clapping the lid on to a\r\nquiver full of arrows. As soon as he had done so he shouted, and cried\r\n'Shoo, shoo,' after his sheep to drive them on to the mountain; so I was\r\nleft to scheme some way of taking my revenge and covering myself with\r\nglory.", "\"In the end I deemed it would be the best plan to do as follows: The\r\nCyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens;\r\nit was of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending to use it for\r\na staff as soon as it should be dry. It was so huge that we could\r\nonly compare it to the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel of large\r\nburden, and able to venture out into open sea. I went up to this club\r\nand cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this piece to the men and\r\ntold them to fine it evenly off at one end, which they proceeded to do,\r\nand lastly I brought it to a point myself, charring the end in the fire\r\nto make it harder. When I had done this I hid it under dung, which was\r\nlying about all over the cave, and told the men to cast lots which of\r\nthem should venture along with myself to lift it and bore it into the\r\nmonster's eye while he was asleep. The lot fell upon the very four whom\r\nI should have chosen, and I myself made five. In the evening the wretch\r\ncame back from shepherding, and drove his flocks into the cave--this\r\ntime driving them all inside, and not leaving any in the yards; I\r\nsuppose some fancy must have taken him, or a god must have prompted him\r\nto do so. As soon as he had put the stone back to its place against the\r\ndoor, he sat down, milked his ewes and his goats all quite rightly, and\r\nthen let each have her own young one; when he had got through with all\r\nthis work, he gripped up two more of my men, and made his supper off\r\nthem. So I went up to him with an ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my\r\nhands:", "\"'Look here, Cyclops,' said I, you have been eating a great deal of\r\nman's flesh, so take this and drink some wine, that you may see what\r\nkind of liquor we had on board my ship. I was bringing it to you as a\r\ndrink-offering, in the hope that you would take compassion upon me and\r\nfurther me on my way home, whereas all you do is to go on ramping and\r\nraving most intolerably. You ought to be ashamed of yourself; how can\r\nyou expect people to come see you any more if you treat them in this\r\nway?'", "\"He then took the cup and drank. He was so delighted with the taste of\r\nthe wine that he begged me for another bowl full. 'Be so kind,' he said,\r\n'as to give me some more, and tell me your name at once. I want to make\r\nyou a present that you will be glad to have. We have wine even in this\r\ncountry, for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens them, but this\r\ndrinks like Nectar and Ambrosia all in one.'", "\"I then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for him, and\r\nthree times did he drain it without thought or heed; then, when I saw\r\nthat the wine had got into his head, I said to him as plausibly as\r\nI could: 'Cyclops, you ask my name and I will tell it you; give me,\r\ntherefore, the present you promised me; my name is Noman; this is what\r\nmy father and mother and my friends have always called me.'", "\"But the cruel wretch said, 'Then I will eat all Noman's comrades before\r\nNoman himself, and will keep Noman for the last. This is the present\r\nthat I will make him.'", "\"As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground.\r\nHis great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon\r\nhim. Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets of\r\nhuman flesh on which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk. Then I\r\nthrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heat it, and encouraged\r\nmy men lest any of them should turn faint-hearted. When the wood, green\r\nthough it was, was about to blaze, I drew it out of the fire glowing\r\nwith heat, and my men gathered round me, for heaven had filled their\r\nhearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of the beam into the\r\nmonster's eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept turning it\r\nround and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship's plank with an\r\nauger, which two men with a wheel and strap can keep on turning as long\r\nas they choose. Even thus did we bore the red hot beam into his eye,\r\ntill the boiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked it round and\r\nround, so that the steam from the burning eyeball scalded his eyelids\r\nand eyebrows, and the roots of the eye sputtered in the fire. As a\r\nblacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet into cold water to temper it--for\r\nit is this that gives strength to the iron--and it makes a great hiss as\r\nhe does so, even thus did the Cyclops' eye hiss round the beam of olive\r\nwood, and his hideous yells made the cave ring again. We ran away in a\r\nfright, but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore from his eye,\r\nand hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as he did\r\nso to the other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him;\r\nso they gathered from all quarters round his cave when they heard him\r\ncrying, and asked what was the matter with him.", "\"'What ails you, Polyphemus,' said they, 'that you make such a noise,\r\nbreaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us from being able\r\nto sleep? Surely no man is carrying off your sheep? Surely no man is\r\ntrying to kill you either by fraud or by force?'", "\"But Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, 'Noman is killing\r\nme by fraud; no man is killing me by force.'", "\"'Then,' said they, 'if no man is attacking you, you must be ill; when\r\nJove makes people ill, there is no help for it, and you had better pray\r\nto your father Neptune.'", "\"Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my clever\r\nstratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain, felt about\r\nwith his hands till he found the stone and took it from the door; then\r\nhe sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front of it to catch\r\nanyone going out with the sheep, for he thought I might be foolish\r\nenough to attempt this.", "\"As for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save my own\r\nlife and those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as one who knows\r\nthat his life depends upon it, for the danger was very great. In the\r\nend I deemed that this plan would be the best; the male sheep were well\r\ngrown, and carried a heavy black fleece, so I bound them noiselessly in\r\nthrees together, with some of the withies on which the wicked monster\r\nused to sleep. There was to be a man under the middle sheep, and the two\r\non either side were to cover him, so that there were three sheep to each\r\nman. As for myself there was a ram finer than any of the others, so I\r\ncaught hold of him by the back, esconced myself in the thick wool under\r\nhis belly, and hung on patiently to his fleece, face upwards, keeping a\r\nfirm hold on it all the time.", "\"Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came, but\r\nwhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the male sheep\r\nhurried out to feed, while the ewes remained bleating about the pens\r\nwaiting to be milked, for their udders were full to bursting; but their\r\nmaster in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the sheep as they\r\nstood upright, without being sharp enough to find out that the men were\r\nunderneath their bellies. As the ram was going out, last of all, heavy\r\nwith its fleece and with the weight of my crafty self, Polyphemus laid\r\nhold of it and said:", "\"'My good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave this\r\nmorning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but lead the\r\nmob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and are the\r\nfirst to come home again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is it\r\nbecause you know your master has lost his eye, and are sorry because\r\nthat wicked Noman and his horrid crew has got him down in his drink and\r\nblinded him? But I will have his life yet. If you could understand and\r\ntalk, you would tell me where the wretch is hiding, and I would dash his\r\nbrains upon the ground till they flew all over the cave. I should thus\r\nhave some satisfaction for the harm this no-good Noman has done me.'", "\"As he spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way\r\nout from the cave and yards, I first got from under the ram's belly,\r\nand then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat, by\r\nconstantly heading them in the right direction we managed to drive them\r\ndown to the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who\r\nhad escaped death, but wept for the others whom the Cyclops had killed.\r\nHowever, I made signs to them by nodding and frowning that they were to\r\nhush their crying, and told them to get all the sheep on board at once\r\nand put out to sea; so they went aboard, took their places, and smote\r\nthe grey sea with their oars. Then, when I had got as far out as my\r\nvoice would reach, I began to jeer at the Cyclops.", "\"'Cyclops,' said I, 'you should have taken better measure of your man\r\nbefore eating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, eat up your\r\nvisitors in your own house? You might have known that your sin would\r\nfind you out, and now Jove and the other gods have punished you.'", "\"He got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the top from\r\noff a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship so that\r\nit was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder. {81} The sea\r\nquaked as the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised\r\ncarried us back towards the mainland, and forced us towards the shore.\r\nBut I snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off, making signs to my\r\nmen by nodding my head, that they must row for their lives, whereon they\r\nlaid out with a will. When we had got twice as far as we were before, I\r\nwas for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men begged and prayed of\r\nme to hold my tongue.", "\"'Do not,' they exclaimed, 'be mad enough to provoke this savage\r\ncreature further; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us\r\nback again to the mainland, and we made sure it had been the death\r\nof us; if he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have\r\npounded our heads and our ship's timbers into a jelly with the rugged\r\nrocks he would have heaved at us, for he can throw them a long way.'", "\"But I would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in my rage,\r\n'Cyclops, if any one asks you who it was that put your eye out and\r\nspoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son of\r\nLaertes, who lives in Ithaca.'", "\"On this he groaned, and cried out, 'Alas, alas, then the old prophecy\r\nabout me is coming true. There was a prophet here, at one time, a man\r\nboth brave and of great stature, Telemus son of Eurymus, who was an\r\nexcellent seer, and did all the prophesying for the Cyclopes till he\r\ngrew old; he told me that all this would happen to me some day, and said\r\nI should lose my sight by the hand of Ulysses. I have been all along\r\nexpecting some one of imposing presence and superhuman strength, whereas\r\nhe turns out to be a little insignificant weakling, who has managed to\r\nblind my eye by taking advantage of me in my drink; come here, then,\r\nUlysses, that I may make you presents to show my hospitality, and urge\r\nNeptune to help you forward on your journey--for Neptune and I are\r\nfather and son. He, if he so will, shall heal me, which no one else\r\nneither god nor man can do.'", "\"Then I said, 'I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and\r\nsending you down to the house of Hades, as I am that it will take more\r\nthan Neptune to cure that eye of yours.'", "\"On this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven and prayed,\r\nsaying, 'Hear me, great Neptune; if I am indeed your own true begotten\r\nson, grant that Ulysses may never reach his home alive; or if he must\r\nget back to his friends at last, let him do so late and in sore plight\r\nafter losing all his men [let him reach his home in another man's ship\r\nand find trouble in his house.'] {82}", "\"Thus did he pray, and Neptune heard his prayer. Then he picked up\r\na rock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it with\r\nprodigious force. It fell just short of the ship, but was within a\r\nlittle of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock fell\r\ninto it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards on our way\r\ntowards the shore of the island.", "\"When at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of our\r\nships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting our\r\nreturn. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on to the\r\nsea shore; we also landed the Cyclops' sheep, and divided them equitably\r\namongst us so that none might have reason to complain. As for the ram,\r\nmy companions agreed that I should have it as an extra share; so I\r\nsacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned its thigh bones to Jove, who\r\nis the lord of all. But he heeded not my sacrifice, and only thought how\r\nhe might destroy both my ships and my comrades.", "\"Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted\r\nour fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went down and it came on\r\ndark, we camped upon the beach. When the child of morning rosy-fingered\r\nDawn appeared, I bade my men on board and loose the hawsers. Then they\r\ntook their places and smote the grey sea with their oars; so we sailed\r\non with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have escaped death though we\r\nhad lost our comrades.", "\r\nBook X", "AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.", "\"Thence we went on to the Aeolian island where lives Aeolus son of\r\nHippotas, dear to the immortal gods. It is an island that floats (as\r\nit were) upon the sea, {83} iron bound with a wall that girds it. Now,\r\nAeolus has six daughters and six lusty sons, so he made the sons marry\r\nthe daughters, and they all live with their dear father and mother,\r\nfeasting and enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day long the\r\natmosphere of the house is loaded with the savour of roasting meats till\r\nit groans again, yard and all; but by night they sleep on their well\r\nmade bedsteads, each with his own wife between the blankets. These were\r\nthe people among whom we had now come.", "\"Aeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions all the\r\ntime about Troy, the Argive fleet, and the return of the Achaeans. I\r\ntold him exactly how everything had happened, and when I said I must go,\r\nand asked him to further me on my way, he made no sort of difficulty,\r\nbut set about doing so at once. Moreover, he flayed me a prime ox-hide\r\nto hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shut up in the hide as\r\nin a sack--for Jove had made him captain over the winds, and he could\r\nstir or still each one of them according to his own pleasure. He put\r\nthe sack in the ship and bound the mouth so tightly with a silver thread\r\nthat not even a breath of a side-wind could blow from any quarter. The\r\nWest wind which was fair for us did he alone let blow as it chose; but\r\nit all came to nothing, for we were lost through our own folly.", "\"Nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on the tenth day our native\r\nland showed on the horizon. We got so close in that we could see the\r\nstubble fires burning, and I, being then dead beat, fell into a light\r\nsleep, for I had never let the rudder out of my own hands, that we might\r\nget home the faster. On this the men fell to talking among themselves,\r\nand said I was bringing back gold and silver in the sack that Aeolus\r\nhad given me. 'Bless my heart,' would one turn to his neighbour, saying,\r\n'how this man gets honoured and makes friends to whatever city or\r\ncountry he may go. See what fine prizes he is taking home from Troy,\r\nwhile we, who have travelled just as far as he has, come back with hands\r\nas empty as we set out with--and now Aeolus has given him ever so much\r\nmore. Quick--let us see what it all is, and how much gold and silver\r\nthere is in the sack he gave him.'", "\"Thus they talked and evil counsels prevailed. They loosed the sack,\r\nwhereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm that carried us\r\nweeping out to sea and away from our own country. Then I awoke, and knew\r\nnot whether to throw myself into the sea or to live on and make the best\r\nof it; but I bore it, covered myself up, and lay down in the ship, while\r\nthe men lamented bitterly as the fierce winds bore our fleet back to the\r\nAeolian island.", "\"When we reached it we went ashore to take in water, and dined hard by\r\nthe ships. Immediately after dinner I took a herald and one of my men\r\nand went straight to the house of Aeolus, where I found him feasting\r\nwith his wife and family; so we sat down as suppliants on the threshold.\r\nThey were astounded when they saw us and said, 'Ulysses, what brings you\r\nhere? What god has been ill-treating you? We took great pains to further\r\nyou on your way home to Ithaca, or wherever it was that you wanted to go\r\nto.'", "\"Thus did they speak, but I answered sorrowfully, 'My men have undone\r\nme; they, and cruel sleep, have ruined me. My friends, mend me this\r\nmischief, for you can if you will.'", "\"I spoke as movingly as I could, but they said nothing, till their\r\nfather answered, 'Vilest of mankind, get you gone at once out of the\r\nisland; him whom heaven hates will I in no wise help. Be off, for you\r\ncome here as one abhorred of heaven.' And with these words he sent me\r\nsorrowing from his door.", "\"Thence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with long and\r\nfruitless rowing, for there was no longer any wind to help them. Six\r\ndays, night and day did we toil, and on the seventh day we reached the\r\nrocky stronghold of Lamus--Telepylus, the city of the Laestrygonians,\r\nwhere the shepherd who is driving in his sheep and goats [to be milked]\r\nsalutes him who is driving out his flock [to feed] and this last answers\r\nthe salute. In that country a man who could do without sleep might earn\r\ndouble wages, one as a herdsman of cattle, and another as a shepherd,\r\nfor they work much the same by night as they do by day. {84}", "\"When we reached the harbour we found it land-locked under steep cliffs,\r\nwith a narrow entrance between two headlands. My captains took all their\r\nships inside, and made them fast close to one another, for there was\r\nnever so much as a breath of wind inside, but it was always dead calm. I\r\nkept my own ship outside, and moored it to a rock at the very end of the\r\npoint; then I climbed a high rock to reconnoitre, but could see no sign\r\nneither of man nor cattle, only some smoke rising from the ground. So I\r\nsent two of my company with an attendant to find out what sort of people\r\nthe inhabitants were.", "\"The men when they got on shore followed a level road by which the\r\npeople draw their firewood from the mountains into the town, till\r\npresently they met a young woman who had come outside to fetch water,\r\nand who was daughter to a Laestrygonian named Antiphates. She was going\r\nto the fountain Artacia from which the people bring in their water, and\r\nwhen my men had come close up to her, they asked her who the king of\r\nthat country might be, and over what kind of people he ruled; so she\r\ndirected them to her father's house, but when they got there they found\r\nhis wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain, and they were horrified\r\nat the sight of her.", "\"She at once called her husband Antiphates from the place of assembly,\r\nand forthwith he set about killing my men. He snatched up one of them,\r\nand began to make his dinner off him then and there, whereon the other\r\ntwo ran back to the ships as fast as ever they could. But Antiphates\r\nraised a hue-and-cry after them, and thousands of sturdy Laestrygonians\r\nsprang up from every quarter--ogres, not men. They threw vast rocks at\r\nus from the cliffs as though they had been mere stones, and I heard\r\nthe horrid sound of the ships crunching up against one another, and the\r\ndeath cries of my men, as the Laestrygonians speared them like fishes\r\nand took them home to eat them. While they were thus killing my men\r\nwithin the harbour I drew my sword, cut the cable of my own ship, and\r\ntold my men to row with all their might if they too would not fare like\r\nthe rest; so they laid out for their lives, and we were thankful enough\r\nwhen we got into open water out of reach of the rocks they hurled at us.\r\nAs for the others there was not one of them left.", "\"Thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped death, though we had\r\nlost our comrades, and came to the Aeaean island, where Circe lives--a\r\ngreat and cunning goddess who is own sister to the magician Aeetes--for\r\nthey are both children of the sun by Perse, who is daughter to Oceanus.\r\nWe brought our ship into a safe harbour without a word, for some god\r\nguided us thither, and having landed we lay there for two days and two\r\nnights, worn out in body and mind. When the morning of the third day\r\ncame I took my spear and my sword, and went away from the ship to\r\nreconnoitre, and see if I could discover signs of human handiwork,\r\nor hear the sound of voices. Climbing to the top of a high look-out I\r\nespied the smoke of Circe's house rising upwards amid a dense forest of\r\ntrees, and when I saw this I doubted whether, having seen the smoke, I\r\nwould not go on at once and find out more, but in the end I deemed it\r\nbest to go back to the ship, give the men their dinners, and send some\r\nof them instead of going myself.", "\"When I had nearly got back to the ship some god took pity upon my\r\nsolitude, and sent a fine antlered stag right into the middle of my\r\npath. He was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of the\r\nriver, for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed I struck\r\nhim in the middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear went clean\r\nthrough him, and he lay groaning in the dust until the life went out of\r\nhim. Then I set my foot upon him, drew my spear from the wound, and laid\r\nit down; I also gathered rough grass and rushes and twisted them into a\r\nfathom or so of good stout rope, with which I bound the four feet of\r\nthe noble creature together; having so done I hung him round my neck and\r\nwalked back to the ship leaning upon my spear, for the stag was much too\r\nbig for me to be able to carry him on my shoulder, steadying him with\r\none hand. As I threw him down in front of the ship, I called the men\r\nand spoke cheeringly man by man to each of them. 'Look here my friends,'\r\nsaid I, 'we are not going to die so much before our time after all, and\r\nat any rate we will not starve so long as we have got something to eat\r\nand drink on board.' On this they uncovered their heads upon the sea\r\nshore and admired the stag, for he was indeed a splendid fellow. Then,\r\nwhen they had feasted their eyes upon him sufficiently, they washed\r\ntheir hands and began to cook him for dinner.", "\"Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we stayed\r\nthere eating and drinking our fill, but when the sun went down and it\r\ncame on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. When the child of morning,\r\nrosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I called a council and said, 'My friends,\r\nwe are in very great difficulties; listen therefore to me. We have no\r\nidea where the sun either sets or rises, {85} so that we do not even\r\nknow East from West. I see no way out of it; nevertheless, we must try\r\nand find one. We are certainly on an island, for I went as high as\r\nI could this morning, and saw the sea reaching all round it to the\r\nhorizon; it lies low, but towards the middle I saw smoke rising from out\r\nof a thick forest of trees.'", "\"Their hearts sank as they heard me, for they remembered how they had\r\nbeen treated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates, and by the savage ogre\r\nPolyphemus. They wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was nothing to\r\nbe got by crying, so I divided them into two companies and set a captain\r\nover each; I gave one company to Eurylochus, while I took command of\r\nthe other myself. Then we cast lots in a helmet, and the lot fell upon\r\nEurylochus; so he set out with his twenty-two men, and they wept, as\r\nalso did we who were left behind.", "\"When they reached Circe's house they found it built of cut stones, on\r\na site that could be seen from far, in the middle of the forest.\r\nThere were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all round it--poor\r\nbewitched creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantments and drugged\r\ninto subjection. They did not attack my men, but wagged their great\r\ntails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their noses lovingly against them.\r\n{86} As hounds crowd round their master when they see him coming from\r\ndinner--for they know he will bring them something--even so did these\r\nwolves and lions with their great claws fawn upon my men, but the men\r\nwere terribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures. Presently\r\nthey reached the gates of the goddess's house, and as they stood there\r\nthey could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully as she worked at\r\nher loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such dazzling colours\r\nas no one but a goddess could weave. On this Polites, whom I valued and\r\ntrusted more than any other of my men, said, 'There is some one inside\r\nworking at a loom and singing most beautifully; the whole place resounds\r\nwith it, let us call her and see whether she is woman or goddess.'", "\"They called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade them\r\nenter. They, thinking no evil, followed her, all except Eurylochus, who\r\nsuspected mischief and staid outside. When she had got them into her\r\nhouse, she set them upon benches and seats and mixed them a mess with\r\ncheese, honey, meal, and Pramnian wine, but she drugged it with wicked\r\npoisons to make them forget their homes, and when they had drunk she\r\nturned them into pigs by a stroke of her wand, and shut them up in her\r\npig-styes. They were like pigs--head, hair, and all, and they grunted\r\njust as pigs do; but their senses were the same as before, and they\r\nremembered everything.", "\"Thus then were they shut up squealing, and Circe threw them some acorns\r\nand beech masts such as pigs eat, but Eurylochus hurried back to tell me\r\nabout the sad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome with dismay\r\nthat though he tried to speak he could find no words to do so; his eyes\r\nfilled with tears and he could only sob and sigh, till at last we forced\r\nhis story out of him, and he told us what had happened to the others.", "\"'We went,' said he, 'as you told us, through the forest, and in the\r\nmiddle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place\r\nthat could be seen from far. There we found a woman, or else she was a\r\ngoddess, working at her loom and singing sweetly; so the men shouted to\r\nher and called her, whereon she at once came down, opened the door, and\r\ninvited us in. The others did not suspect any mischief so they followed\r\nher into the house, but I staid where I was, for I thought there might\r\nbe some treachery. From that moment I saw them no more, for not one of\r\nthem ever came out, though I sat a long time watching for them.'", "\"Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; I also\r\ntook my bow, and told Eurylochus to come back with me and shew me the\r\nway. But he laid hold of me with both his hands and spoke piteously,\r\nsaying, 'Sir, do not force me to go with you, but let me stay here, for\r\nI know you will not bring one of them back with you, nor even return\r\nalive yourself; let us rather see if we cannot escape at any rate with\r\nthe few that are left us, for we may still save our lives.'", "\"'Stay where you are, then,' answered I, 'eating and drinking at the\r\nship, but I must go, for I am most urgently bound to do so.'", "\"With this I left the ship and went up inland. When I got through the\r\ncharmed grove, and was near the great house of the enchantress Circe,\r\nI met Mercury with his golden wand, disguised as a young man in the\r\nhey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon his\r\nface. He came up to me and took my hand within his own, saying, 'My poor\r\nunhappy man, whither are you going over this mountain top, alone and\r\nwithout knowing the way? Your men are shut up in Circe's pigstyes, like\r\nso many wild boars in their lairs. You surely do not fancy that you can\r\nset them free? I can tell you that you will never get back and will have\r\nto stay there with the rest of them. But never mind, I will protect\r\nyou and get you out of your difficulty. Take this herb, which is one\r\nof great virtue, and keep it about you when you go to Circe's house, it\r\nwill be a talisman to you against every kind of mischief.", "\"'And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe will try\r\nto practice upon you. She will mix a mess for you to drink, and she will\r\ndrug the meal with which she makes it, but she will not be able to charm\r\nyou, for the virtue of the herb that I shall give you will prevent her\r\nspells from working. I will tell you all about it. When Circe strikes\r\nyou with her wand, draw your sword and spring upon her as though you\r\nwere going to kill her. She will then be frightened, and will desire you\r\nto go to bed with her; on this you must not point blank refuse her, for\r\nyou want her to set your companions free, and to take good care also of\r\nyourself, but you must make her swear solemnly by all the blessed gods\r\nthat she will plot no further mischief against you, or else when she has\r\ngot you naked she will unman you and make you fit for nothing.'", "\"As he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground and shewed me what it\r\nwas like. The root was black, while the flower was as white as milk; the\r\ngods call it Moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, but the gods can do\r\nwhatever they like.", "\"Then Mercury went back to high Olympus passing over the wooded island;\r\nbut I fared onward to the house of Circe, and my heart was clouded with\r\ncare as I walked along. When I got to the gates I stood there and called\r\nthe goddess, and as soon as she heard me she came down, opened the door,\r\nand asked me to come in; so I followed her--much troubled in my mind.\r\nShe set me on a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver, there was a\r\nfootstool also under my feet, and she mixed a mess in a golden goblet\r\nfor me to drink; but she drugged it, for she meant me mischief. When she\r\nhad given it me, and I had drunk it without its charming me, she struck\r\nme with her wand. 'There now,' she cried, 'be off to the pigstye, and\r\nmake your lair with the rest of them.'", "\"But I rushed at her with my sword drawn as though I would kill her,\r\nwhereon she fell with a loud scream, clasped my knees, and spoke\r\npiteously, saying, 'Who and whence are you? from what place and people\r\nhave you come? How can it be that my drugs have no power to charm you?\r\nNever yet was any man able to stand so much as a taste of the herb I\r\ngave you; you must be spell-proof; surely you can be none other than the\r\nbold hero Ulysses, who Mercury always said would come here some day with\r\nhis ship while on his way home from Troy; so be it then; sheathe your\r\nsword and let us go to bed, that we may make friends and learn to trust\r\neach other.'", "\"And I answered, 'Circe, how can you expect me to be friendly with you\r\nwhen you have just been turning all my men into pigs? And now that you\r\nhave got me here myself, you mean me mischief when you ask me to go to\r\nbed with you, and will unman me and make me fit for nothing. I shall\r\ncertainly not consent to go to bed with you unless you will first take\r\nyour solemn oath to plot no further harm against me.'", "\"So she swore at once as I had told her, and when she had completed her\r\noath then I went to bed with her.", "\"Meanwhile her four servants, who are her housemaids, set about their\r\nwork. They are the children of the groves and fountains, and of the\r\nholy waters that run down into the sea. One of them spread a fair purple\r\ncloth over a seat, and laid a carpet underneath it. Another brought\r\ntables of silver up to the seats, and set them with baskets of gold. A\r\nthird mixed some sweet wine with water in a silver bowl and put golden\r\ncups upon the tables, while the fourth brought in water and set it to\r\nboil in a large cauldron over a good fire which she had lighted. When\r\nthe water in the cauldron was boiling, {87} she poured cold into it\r\ntill it was just as I liked it, and then she set me in a bath and began\r\nwashing me from the cauldron about the head and shoulders, to take the\r\ntire and stiffness out of my limbs. As soon as she had done washing me\r\nand anointing me with oil, she arrayed me in a good cloak and shirt\r\nand led me to a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a\r\nfootstool also under my feet. A maid servant then brought me water in a\r\nbeautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for me to wash\r\nmy hands, and she drew a clean table beside me; an upper servant brought\r\nme bread and offered me many things of what there was in the house, and\r\nthen Circe bade me eat, but I would not, and sat without heeding what\r\nwas before me, still moody and suspicious.", "\"When Circe saw me sitting there without eating, and in great grief, she\r\ncame to me and said, 'Ulysses, why do you sit like that as though you\r\nwere dumb, gnawing at your own heart, and refusing both meat and drink?\r\nIs it that you are still suspicious? You ought not to be, for I have\r\nalready sworn solemnly that I will not hurt you.'", "\"And I said, 'Circe, no man with any sense of what is right can think of\r\neither eating or drinking in your house until you have set his friends\r\nfree and let him see them. If you want me to eat and drink, you must\r\nfree my men and bring them to me that I may see them with my own eyes.'", "\"When I had said this she went straight through the court with her wand\r\nin her hand and opened the pigstye doors. My men came out like so many\r\nprime hogs and stood looking at her, but she went about among them and\r\nanointed each with a second drug, whereon the bristles that the bad drug\r\nhad given them fell off, and they became men again, younger than they\r\nwere before, and much taller and better looking. They knew me at once,\r\nseized me each of them by the hand, and wept for joy till the whole\r\nhouse was filled with the sound of their halloa-ballooing, and Circe\r\nherself was so sorry for them that she came up to me and said, 'Ulysses,\r\nnoble son of Laertes, go back at once to the sea where you have left\r\nyour ship, and first draw it on to the land. Then, hide all your ship's\r\ngear and property in some cave, and come back here with your men.'", "\"I agreed to this, so I went back to the sea shore, and found the men at\r\nthe ship weeping and wailing most piteously. When they saw me the silly\r\nblubbering fellows began frisking round me as calves break out and\r\ngambol round their mothers, when they see them coming home to be milked\r\nafter they have been feeding all day, and the homestead resounds with\r\ntheir lowing. They seemed as glad to see me as though they had got back\r\nto their own rugged Ithaca, where they had been born and bred. 'Sir,'\r\nsaid the affectionate creatures, 'we are as glad to see you back as\r\nthough we had got safe home to Ithaca; but tell us all about the fate of\r\nour comrades.'", "\"I spoke comfortingly to them and said, 'We must draw our ship on to the\r\nland, and hide the ship's gear with all our property in some cave; then\r\ncome with me all of you as fast as you can to Circe's house, where\r\nyou will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst of great\r\nabundance.'", "\"On this the men would have come with me at once, but Eurylochus tried\r\nto hold them back and said, 'Alas, poor wretches that we are, what will\r\nbecome of us? Rush not on your ruin by going to the house of Circe, who\r\nwill turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions, and we shall have to\r\nkeep guard over her house. Remember how the Cyclops treated us when our\r\ncomrades went inside his cave, and Ulysses with them. It was all through\r\nhis sheer folly that those men lost their lives.'", "\"When I heard him I was in two minds whether or no to draw the keen\r\nblade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in spite of\r\nhis being a near relation of my own; but the men interceded for him\r\nand said, 'Sir, if it may so be, let this fellow stay here and mind the\r\nship, but take the rest of us with you to Circe's house.'", "\"On this we all went inland, and Eurylochus was not left behind after\r\nall, but came on too, for he was frightened by the severe reprimand that\r\nI had given him.", "\"Meanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men who had been left behind\r\nwere washed and anointed with olive oil; she had also given them woollen\r\ncloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them all comfortably at\r\ndinner in her house. As soon as the men saw each other face to face\r\nand knew one another, they wept for joy and cried aloud till the whole\r\npalace rang again. Thereon Circe came up to me and said, 'Ulysses, noble\r\nson of Laertes, tell your men to leave off crying; I know how much you\r\nhave all of you suffered at sea, and how ill you have fared among cruel\r\nsavages on the mainland, but that is over now, so stay here, and eat and\r\ndrink till you are once more as strong and hearty as you were when you\r\nleft Ithaca; for at present you are weakened both in body and mind; you\r\nkeep all the time thinking of the hardships you have suffered during\r\nyour travels, so that you have no more cheerfulness left in you.'", "\"Thus did she speak and we assented. We stayed with Circe for a whole\r\ntwelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat and wine. But\r\nwhen the year had passed in the waning of moons and the long days had\r\ncome round, my men called me apart and said, 'Sir, it is time you began\r\nto think about going home, if so be you are to be spared to see your\r\nhouse and native country at all.'", "\"Thus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelong day to\r\nthe going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine, but when\r\nthe sun went down and it came on dark the men laid themselves down to\r\nsleep in the covered cloisters. I, however, after I had got into bed\r\nwith Circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddess listened to what\r\nI had got to say. 'Circe,' said I, 'please to keep the promise you made\r\nme about furthering me on my homeward voyage. I want to get back and so\r\ndo my men, they are always pestering me with their complaints as soon as\r\never your back is turned.'", "\"And the goddess answered, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall\r\nnone of you stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there\r\nis another journey which you have got to take before you can sail\r\nhomewards. You must go to the house of Hades and of dread Proserpine to\r\nconsult the ghost of the blind Theban prophet Teiresias, whose reason is\r\nstill unshaken. To him alone has Proserpine left his understanding even\r\nin death, but the other ghosts flit about aimlessly.'", "\"I was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in bed and wept, and would\r\ngladly have lived no longer to see the light of the sun, but presently\r\nwhen I was tired of weeping and tossing myself about, I said, 'And who\r\nshall guide me upon this voyage--for the house of Hades is a port that\r\nno ship can reach.'", "\"'You will want no guide,' she answered; 'raise your mast, set your\r\nwhite sails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you there\r\nof itself. When your ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you will\r\nreach the fertile shore of Proserpine's country with its groves of tall\r\npoplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach your\r\nship upon the shore of Oceanus, and go straight on to the dark abode of\r\nHades. You will find it near the place where the rivers Pyriphlegethon\r\nand Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx) flow into Acheron, and\r\nyou will see a rock near it, just where the two roaring rivers run into\r\none another.", "\"'When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench\r\na cubit or so in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a\r\ndrink-offering to all the dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then wine,\r\nand in the third place water--sprinkling white barley meal over the\r\nwhole. Moreover you must offer many prayers to the poor feeble ghosts,\r\nand promise them that when you get back to Ithaca you will sacrifice a\r\nbarren heifer to them, the best you have, and will load the pyre with\r\ngood things. More particularly you must promise that Teiresias shall\r\nhave a black sheep all to himself, the finest in all your flocks.", "\"'When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers, offer\r\nthem a ram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards Erebus; but\r\nyourself turn away from them as though you would make towards the river.\r\nOn this, many dead men's ghosts will come to you, and you must tell your\r\nmen to skin the two sheep that you have just killed, and offer them as a\r\nburnt sacrifice with prayers to Hades and to Proserpine. Then draw your\r\nsword and sit there, so as to prevent any other poor ghost from\r\ncoming near the spilt blood before Teiresias shall have answered your\r\nquestions. The seer will presently come to you, and will tell you about\r\nyour voyage--what stages you are to make, and how you are to sail the\r\nsea so as to reach your home.'", "\"It was day-break by the time she had done speaking, so she dressed\r\nme in my shirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a beautiful light\r\ngossamer fabric over her shoulders, fastening it with a golden girdle\r\nround her waist, and she covered her head with a mantle. Then I went\r\nabout among the men everywhere all over the house, and spoke kindly to\r\neach of them man by man: 'You must not lie sleeping here any longer,'\r\nsaid I to them, 'we must be going, for Circe has told me all about it.'\r\nAnd on this they did as I bade them.", "\"Even so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure. We had\r\nwith us a certain youth named Elpenor, not very remarkable for sense or\r\ncourage, who had got drunk and was lying on the house-top away from the\r\nrest of the men, to sleep off his liquor in the cool. When he heard the\r\nnoise of the men bustling about, he jumped up on a sudden and forgot\r\nall about coming down by the main staircase, so he tumbled right off the\r\nroof and broke his neck, and his soul went down to the house of Hades.", "\"When I had got the men together I said to them, 'You think you are\r\nabout to start home again, but Circe has explained to me that instead of\r\nthis, we have got to go to the house of Hades and Proserpine to consult\r\nthe ghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias.'", "\"The men were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threw themselves\r\non the ground groaning and tearing their hair, but they did not mend\r\nmatters by crying. When we reached the sea shore, weeping and lamenting\r\nour fate, Circe brought the ram and the ewe, and we made them fast hard\r\nby the ship. She passed through the midst of us without our knowing it,\r\nfor who can see the comings and goings of a god, if the god does not\r\nwish to be seen?", "\r\nBook XI", "THE VISIT TO THE DEAD. {88}", "\"Then, when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship into the\r\nwater and got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheep on\r\nboard and took our places, weeping and in great distress of mind. Circe,\r\nthat great and cunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew dead aft\r\nand staid steadily with us keeping our sails all the time well filled;\r\nso we did whatever wanted doing to the ship's gear and let her go as the\r\nwind and helmsman headed her. All day long her sails were full as she\r\nheld her course over the sea, but when the sun went down and darkness\r\nwas over all the earth, we got into the deep waters of the river\r\nOceanus, where lie the land and city of the Cimmerians who live\r\nenshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun never pierce\r\nneither at his rising nor as he goes down again out of the heavens, but\r\nthe poor wretches live in one long melancholy night. When we got there\r\nwe beached the ship, took the sheep out of her, and went along by the\r\nwaters of Oceanus till we came to the place of which Circe had told us.", "\"Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my sword\r\nand dug the trench a cubit each way. I made a drink-offering to all the\r\ndead, first with honey and milk, then with wine, and thirdly with water,\r\nand I sprinkled white barley meal over the whole, praying earnestly to\r\nthe poor feckless ghosts, and promising them that when I got back to\r\nIthaca I would sacrifice a barren heifer for them, the best I had, and\r\nwould load the pyre with good things. I also particularly promised\r\nthat Teiresias should have a black sheep to himself, the best in all my\r\nflocks. When I had prayed sufficiently to the dead, I cut the throats of\r\nthe two sheep and let the blood run into the trench, whereon the ghosts\r\ncame trooping up from Erebus--brides, {89} young bachelors, old men worn\r\nout with toil, maids who had been crossed in love, and brave men who had\r\nbeen killed in battle, with their armour still smirched with blood; they\r\ncame from every quarter and flitted round the trench with a strange kind\r\nof screaming sound that made me turn pale with fear. When I saw them\r\ncoming I told the men to be quick and flay the carcasses of the two dead\r\nsheep and make burnt offerings of them, and at the same time to repeat\r\nprayers to Hades and to Proserpine; but I sat where I was with my sword\r\ndrawn and would not let the poor feckless ghosts come near the blood\r\ntill Teiresias should have answered my questions.", "\"The first ghost that came was that of my comrade Elpenor, for he had\r\nnot yet been laid beneath the earth. We had left his body unwaked and\r\nunburied in Circe's house, for we had had too much else to do. I was\r\nvery sorry for him, and cried when I saw him: 'Elpenor,' said I, 'how\r\ndid you come down here into this gloom and darkness? You have got here\r\non foot quicker than I have with my ship.'", "\"'Sir,' he answered with a groan, 'it was all bad luck, and my own\r\nunspeakable drunkenness. I was lying asleep on the top of Circe's house,\r\nand never thought of coming down again by the great staircase but fell\r\nright off the roof and broke my neck, so my soul came down to the house\r\nof Hades. And now I beseech you by all those whom you have left behind\r\nyou, though they are not here, by your wife, by the father who brought\r\nyou up when you were a child, and by Telemachus who is the one hope of\r\nyour house, do what I shall now ask you. I know that when you leave this\r\nlimbo you will again hold your ship for the Aeaean island. Do not\r\ngo thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you, or I may bring\r\nheaven's anger upon you; but burn me with whatever armour I have, build\r\na barrow for me on the sea shore, that may tell people in days to come\r\nwhat a poor unlucky fellow I was, and plant over my grave the oar I used\r\nto row with when I was yet alive and with my messmates.' And I said, 'My\r\npoor fellow, I will do all that you have asked of me.'", "\"Thus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, I on the one\r\nside of the trench with my sword held over the blood, and the ghost\r\nof my comrade saying all this to me from the other side. Then came the\r\nghost of my dead mother Anticlea, daughter to Autolycus. I had left her\r\nalive when I set out for Troy and was moved to tears when I saw her, but\r\neven so, for all my sorrow I would not let her come near the blood till\r\nI had asked my questions of Teiresias.", "\"Then came also the ghost of Theban Teiresias, with his golden sceptre\r\nin his hand. He knew me and said, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, why,\r\npoor man, have you left the light of day and come down to visit the dead\r\nin this sad place? Stand back from the trench and withdraw your sword\r\nthat I may drink of the blood and answer your questions truly.'", "\"So I drew back, and sheathed my sword, whereon when he had drank of the\r\nblood he began with his prophecy.", "\"'You want to know,' said he, 'about your return home, but heaven will\r\nmake this hard for you. I do not think that you will escape the eye\r\nof Neptune, who still nurses his bitter grudge against you for having\r\nblinded his son. Still, after much suffering you may get home if you\r\ncan restrain yourself and your companions when your ship reaches the\r\nThrinacian island, where you will find the sheep and cattle belonging to\r\nthe sun, who sees and gives ear to everything. If you leave these flocks\r\nunharmed and think of nothing but of getting home, you may yet after\r\nmuch hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm them, then I forewarn you of\r\nthe destruction both of your ship and of your men. Even though you may\r\nyourself escape, you will return in bad plight after losing all your\r\nmen, [in another man's ship, and you will find trouble in your house,\r\nwhich will be overrun by high-handed people, who are devouring your\r\nsubstance under the pretext of paying court and making presents to your\r\nwife.", "\"'When you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors; and\r\nafter you have killed them by force or fraud in your own house, you must\r\ntake a well made oar and carry it on and on, till you come to a country\r\nwhere the people have never heard of the sea and do not even mix salt\r\nwith their food, nor do they know anything about ships, and oars that\r\nare as the wings of a ship. I will give you this certain token which\r\ncannot escape your notice. A wayfarer will meet you and will say it must\r\nbe a winnowing shovel that you have got upon your shoulder; on this you\r\nmust fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar\r\nto Neptune. {90} Then go home and offer hecatombs to all the gods in\r\nheaven one after the other. As for yourself, death shall come to you\r\nfrom the sea, and your life shall ebb away very gently when you are full\r\nof years and peace of mind, and your people shall bless you. All that I\r\nhave said will come true].' {91}", "\"'This,' I answered, 'must be as it may please heaven, but tell me and\r\ntell me and tell me true, I see my poor mother's ghost close by us; she\r\nis sitting by the blood without saying a word, and though I am her own\r\nson she does not remember me and speak to me; tell me, Sir, how I can\r\nmake her know me.'", "\"'That,' said he, 'I can soon do. Any ghost that you let taste of the\r\nblood will talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you do not let\r\nthem have any blood they will go away again.'", "\"On this the ghost of Teiresias went back to the house of Hades, for his\r\nprophecyings had now been spoken, but I sat still where I was until my\r\nmother came up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me at once and spoke\r\nfondly to me, saying, 'My son, how did you come down to this abode of\r\ndarkness while you are still alive? It is a hard thing for the living to\r\nsee these places, for between us and them there are great and terrible\r\nwaters, and there is Oceanus, which no man can cross on foot, but he\r\nmust have a good ship to take him. Are you all this time trying to find\r\nyour way home from Troy, and have you never yet got back to Ithaca nor\r\nseen your wife in your own house?'", "\"'Mother,' said I, 'I was forced to come here to consult the ghost of\r\nthe Theban prophet Teiresias. I have never yet been near the Achaean\r\nland nor set foot on my native country, and I have had nothing but one\r\nlong series of misfortunes from the very first day that I set out with\r\nAgamemnon for Ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fight the Trojans. But\r\ntell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die? Did you have a long\r\nillness, or did heaven vouchsafe you a gentle easy passage to eternity?\r\nTell me also about my father, and the son whom I left behind me, is my\r\nproperty still in their hands, or has some one else got hold of it, who\r\nthinks that I shall not return to claim it? Tell me again what my wife\r\nintends doing, and in what mind she is; does she live with my son and\r\nguard my estate securely, or has she made the best match she could and\r\nmarried again?'", "\"My mother answered, 'Your wife still remains in your house, but she is\r\nin great distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears both night\r\nand day. No one as yet has got possession of your fine property, and\r\nTelemachus still holds your lands undisturbed. He has to entertain\r\nlargely, as of course he must, considering his position as a magistrate,\r\n{92} and how every one invites him; your father remains at his old place\r\nin the country and never goes near the town. He has no comfortable bed\r\nnor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in front of the fire\r\nwith the men and goes about all in rags, but in summer, when the warm\r\nweather comes on again, he lies out in the vineyard on a bed of vine\r\nleaves thrown any how upon the ground. He grieves continually about your\r\nnever having come home, and suffers more and more as he grows older. As\r\nfor my own end it was in this wise: heaven did not take me swiftly and\r\npainlessly in my own house, nor was I attacked by any illness such as\r\nthose that generally wear people out and kill them, but my longing to\r\nknow what you were doing and the force of my affection for you--this it\r\nwas that was the death of me.' {93}", "\"Then I tried to find some way of embracing my poor mother's ghost.\r\nThrice I sprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, but each\r\ntime she flitted from my embrace as it were a dream or phantom, and\r\nbeing touched to the quick I said to her, 'Mother, why do you not stay\r\nstill when I would embrace you? If we could throw our arms around one\r\nanother we might find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows even in\r\nthe house of Hades; does Proserpine want to lay a still further load of\r\ngrief upon me by mocking me with a phantom only?'", "\"'My son,' she answered, 'most ill-fated of all mankind, it is not\r\nProserpine that is beguiling you, but all people are like this when they\r\nare dead. The sinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together; these\r\nperish in the fierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has left the\r\nbody, and the soul flits away as though it were a dream. Now, however,\r\ngo back to the light of day as soon as you can, and note all these\r\nthings that you may tell them to your wife hereafter.'", "\"Thus did we converse, and anon Proserpine sent up the ghosts of the\r\nwives and daughters of all the most famous men. They gathered in crowds\r\nabout the blood, and I considered how I might question them severally.\r\nIn the end I deemed that it would be best to draw the keen blade that\r\nhung by my sturdy thigh, and keep them from all drinking the blood at\r\nonce. So they came up one after the other, and each one as I questioned\r\nher told me her race and lineage.", "\"The first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife of\r\nCretheus the son of Aeolus. {94} She fell in love with the river Enipeus\r\nwho is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when she\r\nwas taking a walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as her lover,\r\nlay with her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue wave arched\r\nitself like a mountain over them to hide both woman and god, whereon he\r\nloosed her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber. When the god\r\nhad accomplished the deed of love, he took her hand in his own and\r\nsaid, 'Tyro, rejoice in all good will; the embraces of the gods are not\r\nfruitless, and you will have fine twins about this time twelve months.\r\nTake great care of them. I am Neptune, so now go home, but hold your\r\ntongue and do not tell any one.'", "\"Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Pelias and\r\nNeleus, who both of them served Jove with all their might. Pelias was\r\na great breeder of sheep and lived in Iolcus, but the other lived in\r\nPylos. The rest of her children were by Cretheus, namely, Aeson, Pheres,\r\nand Amythaon, who was a mighty warrior and charioteer.", "\"Next to her I saw Antiope, daughter to Asopus, who could boast of\r\nhaving slept in the arms of even Jove himself, and who bore him two sons\r\nAmphion and Zethus. These founded Thebes with its seven gates, and built\r\na wall all round it; for strong though they were they could not hold\r\nThebes till they had walled it.", "\"Then I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, who also bore to Jove\r\nindomitable Hercules; and Megara who was daughter to great King Creon,\r\nand married the redoubtable son of Amphitryon.", "\"I also saw fair Epicaste mother of king Oedipodes whose awful lot it\r\nwas to marry her own son without suspecting it. He married her after\r\nhaving killed his father, but the gods proclaimed the whole story to the\r\nworld; whereon he remained king of Thebes, in great grief for the spite\r\nthe gods had borne him; but Epicaste went to the house of the mighty\r\njailor Hades, having hanged herself for grief, and the avenging spirits\r\nhaunted him as for an outraged mother--to his ruing bitterly thereafter.", "\"Then I saw Chloris, whom Neleus married for her beauty, having given\r\npriceless presents for her. She was youngest daughter to Amphion son of\r\nIasus and king of Minyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos. She bore\r\nNestor, Chromius, and Periclymenus, and she also bore that marvellously\r\nlovely woman Pero, who was wooed by all the country round; but Neleus\r\nwould only give her to him who should raid the cattle of Iphicles from\r\nthe grazing grounds of Phylace, and this was a hard task. The only man\r\nwho would undertake to raid them was a certain excellent seer, {95} but\r\nthe will of heaven was against him, for the rangers of the cattle caught\r\nhim and put him in prison; nevertheless when a full year had passed and\r\nthe same season came round again, Iphicles set him at liberty, after\r\nhe had expounded all the oracles of heaven. Thus, then, was the will of\r\nJove accomplished.", "\"And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, who bore him two famous sons,\r\nCastor breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer. Both these heroes\r\nare lying under the earth, though they are still alive, for by a special\r\ndispensation of Jove, they die and come to life again, each one of them\r\nevery other day throughout all time, and they have the rank of gods.", "\"After her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus who boasted the embrace\r\nof Neptune. She bore two sons Otus and Ephialtes, but both were short\r\nlived. They were the finest children that were ever born in this world,\r\nand the best looking, Orion only excepted; for at nine years old they\r\nwere nine fathoms high, and measured nine cubits round the chest. They\r\nthreatened to make war with the gods in Olympus, and tried to set Mount\r\nOssa on the top of Mount Olympus, and Mount Pelion on the top of Ossa,\r\nthat they might scale heaven itself, and they would have done it too if\r\nthey had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto, killed both of them,\r\nbefore they had got so much as a sign of hair upon their cheeks or chin.", "\"Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of the\r\nmagician Minos, whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete to Athens, but\r\nhe did not enjoy her, for before he could do so Diana killed her in the\r\nisland of Dia on account of what Bacchus had said against her.", "%(dialogue)s", "Here he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled and speechless\r\nthroughout the covered cloister.

As soon as he\r\nhad tasted the blood, he knew me, and weeping bitterly stretched out his\r\narms towards me to embrace me; but he had no strength nor substance any\r\nmore, and I too wept and pitied him as I beheld him. 'How did you come\r\nby your death,' said I, 'King Agamemnon? Did Neptune raise his winds and\r\nwaves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies make an end\r\nof you on the main land when you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing,\r\nor while they were fighting in defence of their wives and city?'", "\"'Ulysses,' he answered, 'noble son of Laertes, I was not lost at sea\r\nin any storm of Neptune's raising, nor did my foes despatch me upon the\r\nmainland, but Aegisthus and my wicked wife were the death of me between\r\nthem. He asked me to his house, feasted me, and then butchered me most\r\nmiserably as though I were a fat beast in a slaughter house, while all\r\naround me my comrades were slain like sheep or pigs for the wedding\r\nbreakfast, or picnic, or gorgeous banquet of some great nobleman. You\r\nmust have seen numbers of men killed either in a general engagement, or\r\nin single combat, but you never saw anything so truly pitiable as the\r\nway in which we fell in that cloister, with the mixing bowl and the\r\nloaded tables lying all about, and the ground reeking with our blood. I\r\nheard Priam's daughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her close\r\nbeside me. I lay dying upon the earth with the sword in my body, and\r\nraised my hands to kill the slut of a murderess, but she slipped away\r\nfrom me; she would not even close my lips nor my eyes when I was dying,\r\nfor there is nothing in this world so cruel and so shameless as a woman\r\nwhen she has fallen into such guilt as hers was. Fancy murdering her own\r\nhusband! I thought I was going to be welcomed home by my children and my\r\nservants, but her abominable crime has brought disgrace on herself and\r\nall women who shall come after--even on the good ones.'", "\"And I said, 'In truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from first to\r\nlast in the matter of their women's counsels. See how many of us fell\r\nfor Helen's sake, and now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched mischief\r\nagainst you too during your absence.'", "\"'Be sure, therefore,' continued Agamemnon, 'and not be too friendly\r\neven with your own wife. Do not tell her all that you know perfectly\r\nwell yourself. Tell her a part only, and keep your own counsel about the\r\nrest. Not that your wife, Ulysses, is likely to murder you, for Penelope\r\nis a very admirable woman, and has an excellent nature. We left her a\r\nyoung bride with an infant at her breast when we set out for Troy. This\r\nchild no doubt is now grown up happily to man's estate, {96} and he and\r\nhis father will have a joyful meeting and embrace one another as it is\r\nright they should do, whereas my wicked wife did not even allow me\r\nthe happiness of looking upon my son, but killed me ere I could do so.\r\nFurthermore I say--and lay my saying to your heart--do not tell people\r\nwhen you are bringing your ship to Ithaca, but steal a march upon them,\r\nfor after all this there is no trusting women. But now tell me, and\r\ntell me true, can you give me any news of my son Orestes? Is he in\r\nOrchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he at Sparta with Menelaus--for I presume\r\nthat he is still living.'", "\"And I said, 'Agamemnon, why do you ask me? I do not know whether your\r\nson is alive or dead, and it is not right to talk when one does not\r\nknow.'", "\"As we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another the ghost\r\nof Achilles came up to us with Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax who was\r\nthe finest and goodliest man of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus.\r\nThe fleet descendant of Aeacus knew me and spoke piteously, saying,\r\n'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, what deed of daring will you undertake\r\nnext, that you venture down to the house of Hades among us silly dead,\r\nwho are but the ghosts of them that can labour no more?'", "\"And I said, 'Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the\r\nAchaeans, I came to consult Teiresias, and see if he could advise me\r\nabout my return home to Ithaca, for I have never yet been able to get\r\nnear the Achaean land, nor to set foot in my own country, but have been\r\nin trouble all the time. As for you, Achilles, no one was ever yet so\r\nfortunate as you have been, nor ever will be, for you were adored by all\r\nus Argives as long as you were alive, and now that you are here you are\r\na great prince among the dead. Do not, therefore, take it so much to\r\nheart even if you are dead.'", "\"'Say not a word,' he answered, 'in death's favour; I would rather be\r\na paid servant in a poor man's house and be above ground than king of\r\nkings among the dead. But give me news about my son; is he gone to the\r\nwars and will he be a great soldier, or is this not so? Tell me also if\r\nyou have heard anything about my father Peleus--does he still rule among\r\nthe Myrmidons, or do they show him no respect throughout Hellas and\r\nPhthia now that he is old and his limbs fail him? Could I but stand by\r\nhis side, in the light of day, with the same strength that I had when I\r\nkilled the bravest of our foes upon the plain of Troy--could I but be\r\nas I then was and go even for a short time to my father's house, any one\r\nwho tried to do him violence or supersede him would soon rue it.'", "\"'I have heard nothing,' I answered, 'of Peleus, but I can tell you all\r\nabout your son Neoptolemus, for I took him in my own ship from Scyros\r\nwith the Achaeans. In our councils of war before Troy he was always\r\nfirst to speak, and his judgement was unerring. Nestor and I were the\r\nonly two who could surpass him; and when it came to fighting on the\r\nplain of Troy, he would never remain with the body of his men, but would\r\ndash on far in front, foremost of them all in valour. Many a man did\r\nhe kill in battle--I cannot name every single one of those whom he slew\r\nwhile fighting on the side of the Argives, but will only say how\r\nhe killed that valiant hero Eurypylus son of Telephus, who was the\r\nhandsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; many others also of the\r\nCeteians fell around him by reason of a woman's bribes. Moreover, when\r\nall the bravest of the Argives went inside the horse that Epeus had\r\nmade, and it was left to me to settle when we should either open the\r\ndoor of our ambuscade, or close it, though all the other leaders and\r\nchief men among the Danaans were drying their eyes and quaking in every\r\nlimb, I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear from his cheek;\r\nhe was all the time urging me to break out from the horse--grasping\r\nthe handle of his sword and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing fury\r\nagainst the foe. Yet when we had sacked the city of Priam he got his\r\nhandsome share of the prize money and went on board (such is the fortune\r\nof war) without a wound upon him, neither from a thrown spear nor in\r\nclose combat, for the rage of Mars is a matter of great chance.'", "\"When I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across a\r\nmeadow full of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning the\r\nprowess of his son.", "\"The ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own\r\nmelancholy tale; but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloof--still\r\nangry with me for having won the cause in our dispute about the armour\r\nof Achilles. Thetis had offered it as a prize, but the Trojan prisoners\r\nand Minerva were the judges. Would that I had never gained the day in\r\nsuch a contest, for it cost the life of Ajax, who was foremost of all\r\nthe Danaans after the son of Peleus, alike in stature and prowess.", "\"When I saw him I tried to pacify him and said, 'Ajax, will you not\r\nforget and forgive even in death, but must the judgement about that\r\nhateful armour still rankle with you? It cost us Argives dear enough to\r\nlose such a tower of strength as you were to us. We mourned you as much\r\nas we mourned Achilles son of Peleus himself, nor can the blame be laid\r\non anything but on the spite which Jove bore against the Danaans, for it\r\nwas this that made him counsel your destruction--come hither, therefore,\r\nbring your proud spirit into subjection, and hear what I can tell you.'", "\"He would not answer, but turned away to Erebus and to the other ghosts;\r\nnevertheless, I should have made him talk to me in spite of his being\r\nso angry, or I should have gone on talking to him, {97} only that there\r\nwere still others among the dead whom I desired to see.", "\"Then I saw Minos son of Jove with his golden sceptre in his hand\r\nsitting in judgement on the dead, and the ghosts were gathered sitting\r\nand standing round him in the spacious house of Hades, to learn his\r\nsentences upon them.", "\"After him I saw huge Orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving the\r\nghosts of the wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains, and he\r\nhad a great bronze club in his hand, unbreakable for ever and ever.", "\"And I saw Tityus son of Gaia stretched upon the plain and covering some\r\nnine acres of ground. Two vultures on either side of him were digging\r\ntheir beaks into his liver, and he kept on trying to beat them off with\r\nhis hands, but could not; for he had violated Jove's mistress Leto as\r\nshe was going through Panopeus on her way to Pytho.", "\"I saw also the dreadful fate of Tantalus, who stood in a lake that\r\nreached his chin; he was dying to quench his thirst, but could never\r\nreach the water, for whenever the poor creature stooped to drink, it\r\ndried up and vanished, so that there was nothing but dry ground--parched\r\nby the spite of heaven. There were tall trees, moreover, that shed their\r\nfruit over his head--pears, pomegranates, apples, sweet figs and juicy\r\nolives, but whenever the poor creature stretched out his hand to take\r\nsome, the wind tossed the branches back again to the clouds.", "\"And I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone\r\nwith both his hands. With hands and feet he tried to roll it up to the\r\ntop of the hill, but always, just before he could roll it over on to the\r\nother side, its weight would be too much for him, and the pitiless stone\r\n{98} would come thundering down again on to the plain. Then he would\r\nbegin trying to push it up hill again, and the sweat ran off him and the\r\nsteam rose after him.", "\"After him I saw mighty Hercules, but it was his phantom only, for he is\r\nfeasting ever with the immortal gods, and has lovely Hebe to wife, who\r\nis daughter of Jove and Juno. The ghosts were screaming round him like\r\nscared birds flying all whithers. He looked black as night with his bare\r\nbow in his hands and his arrow on the string, glaring around as though\r\never on the point of taking aim. About his breast there was a wondrous\r\ngolden belt adorned in the most marvellous fashion with bears, wild\r\nboars, and lions with gleaming eyes; there was also war, battle, and\r\ndeath. The man who made that belt, do what he might, would never be able\r\nto make another like it. Hercules knew me at once when he saw me, and\r\nspoke piteously, saying, 'My poor Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, are\r\nyou too leading the same sorry kind of life that I did when I was above\r\nground? I was son of Jove, but I went through an infinity of suffering,\r\nfor I became bondsman to one who was far beneath me--a low fellow\r\nwho set me all manner of labours. He once sent me here to fetch the\r\nhell-hound--for he did not think he could find anything harder for me\r\nthan this, but I got the hound out of Hades and brought him to him, for\r\nMercury and Minerva helped me.'", "\"On this Hercules went down again into the house of Hades, but I stayed\r\nwhere I was in case some other of the mighty dead should come to me.\r\nAnd I should have seen still other of them that are gone before, whom\r\nI would fain have seen--Theseus and Pirithous--glorious children of the\r\ngods, but so many thousands of ghosts came round me and uttered such\r\nappalling cries, that I was panic stricken lest Proserpine should send\r\nup from the house of Hades the head of that awful monster Gorgon. On\r\nthis I hastened back to my ship and ordered my men to go on board at\r\nonce and loose the hawsers; so they embarked and took their places,\r\nwhereon the ship went down the stream of the river Oceanus.

We then drew our ship on to the sands\r\nand got out of her on to the shore, where we went to sleep and waited\r\ntill day should break.", "\"Then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I sent\r\nsome men to Circe's house to fetch the body of Elpenor. We cut firewood\r\nfrom a wood where the headland jutted out into the sea, and after we had\r\nwept over him and lamented him we performed his funeral rites. When his\r\nbody and armour had been burned to ashes, we raised a cairn, set a stone\r\nover it, and at the top of the cairn we fixed the oar that he had been\r\nused to row with.", "\"While we were doing all this, Circe, who knew that we had got back from\r\nthe house of Hades, dressed herself and came to us as fast as she could;\r\nand her maid servants came with her bringing us bread, meat, and wine.\r\nThen she stood in the midst of us and said, 'You have done a bold thing\r\nin going down alive to the house of Hades, and you will have died twice,\r\nto other people's once; now, then, stay here for the rest of the\r\nday, feast your fill, and go on with your voyage at daybreak tomorrow\r\nmorning. In the meantime I will tell Ulysses about your course, and\r\nwill explain everything to him so as to prevent your suffering from\r\nmisadventure either by land or sea.'", "\"We agreed to do as she had said, and feasted through the livelong day\r\nto the going down of the sun, but when the sun had set and it came on\r\ndark, the men laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the\r\nship. Then Circe took me by the hand and bade me be seated away from\r\nthe others, while she reclined by my side and asked me all about our\r\nadventures.", "\"'So far so good,' said she, when I had ended my story, 'and now pay\r\nattention to what I am about to tell you--heaven itself, indeed, will\r\nrecall it to your recollection. First you will come to the Sirens who\r\nenchant all who come near them. If any one unwarily draws in too close\r\nand hears the singing of the Sirens, his wife and children will never\r\nwelcome him home again, for they sit in a green field and warble him to\r\ndeath with the sweetness of their song. There is a great heap of dead\r\nmen's bones lying all around, with the flesh still rotting off them.\r\nTherefore pass these Sirens by, and stop your men's ears with wax that\r\nnone of them may hear; but if you like you can listen yourself, for you\r\nmay get the men to bind you as you stand upright on a cross piece half\r\nway up the mast, {99} and they must lash the rope's ends to the mast\r\nitself, that you may have the pleasure of listening. If you beg and pray\r\nthe men to unloose you, then they must bind you faster.", "\"'When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give you\r\ncoherent directions {100} as to which of two courses you are to take; I\r\nwill lay the two alternatives before you, and you must consider them for\r\nyourself. On the one hand there are some overhanging rocks against which\r\nthe deep blue waves of Amphitrite beat with terrific fury; the blessed\r\ngods call these rocks the Wanderers. Here not even a bird may pass, no,\r\nnot even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to Father Jove, but the\r\nsheer rock always carries off one of them, and Father Jove has to send\r\nanother to make up their number; no ship that ever yet came to these\r\nrocks has got away again, but the waves and whirlwinds of fire are\r\nfreighted with wreckage and with the bodies of dead men. The only vessel\r\nthat ever sailed and got through, was the famous Argo on her way from\r\nthe house of Aetes, and she too would have gone against these great\r\nrocks, only that Juno piloted her past them for the love she bore to\r\nJason.", "\"'Of these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost in a\r\ndark cloud. This never leaves it, so that the top is never clear not\r\neven in summer and early autumn. No man though he had twenty hands and\r\ntwenty feet could get a foothold on it and climb it, for it runs sheer\r\nup, as smooth as though it had been polished. In the middle of it there\r\nis a large cavern, looking West and turned towards Erebus; you must\r\ntake your ship this way, but the cave is so high up that not even the\r\nstoutest archer could send an arrow into it. Inside it Scylla sits and\r\nyelps with a voice that you might take to be that of a young hound, but\r\nin truth she is a dreadful monster and no one--not even a god--could\r\nface her without being terror-struck. She has twelve mis-shapen feet,\r\nand six necks of the most prodigious length; and at the end of each neck\r\nshe has a frightful head with three rows of teeth in each, all set very\r\nclose together, so that they would crunch any one to death in a moment,\r\nand she sits deep within her shady cell thrusting out her heads and\r\npeering all round the rock, fishing for dolphins or dogfish or\r\nany larger monster that she can catch, of the thousands with which\r\nAmphitrite teems. No ship ever yet got past her without losing some men,\r\nfor she shoots out all her heads at once, and carries off a man in each\r\nmouth.", "\"'You will find the other rock lie lower, but they are so close together\r\nthat there is not more than a bow-shot between them. [A large fig\r\ntree in full leaf {101} grows upon it], and under it lies the sucking\r\nwhirlpool of Charybdis. Three times in the day does she vomit forth her\r\nwaters, and three times she sucks them down again; see that you be not\r\nthere when she is sucking, for if you are, Neptune himself could not\r\nsave you; you must hug the Scylla side and drive ship by as fast as you\r\ncan, for you had better lose six men than your whole crew.'", "\"'Is there no way,' said I, 'of escaping Charybdis, and at the same time\r\nkeeping Scylla off when she is trying to harm my men?'", "\"'You dare devil,' replied the goddess, 'you are always wanting to fight\r\nsomebody or something; you will not let yourself be beaten even by the\r\nimmortals. For Scylla is not mortal; moreover she is savage, extreme,\r\nrude, cruel and invincible. There is no help for it; your best chance\r\nwill be to get by her as fast as ever you can, for if you dawdle about\r\nher rock while you are putting on your armour, she may catch you with\r\na second cast of her six heads, and snap up another half dozen of your\r\nmen; so drive your ship past her at full speed, and roar out lustily to\r\nCrataiis who is Scylla's dam, bad luck to her; she will then stop her\r\nfrom making a second raid upon you.'", "\"'You will now come to the Thrinacian island, and here you will see\r\nmany herds of cattle and flocks of sheep belonging to the sun-god--seven\r\nherds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head in each\r\nflock. They do not breed, nor do they become fewer in number, and they\r\nare tended by the goddesses Phaethusa and Lampetie, who are children of\r\nthe sun-god Hyperion by Neaera. Their mother when she had borne them and\r\nhad done suckling them sent them to the Thrinacian island, which was\r\na long way off, to live there and look after their father's flocks and\r\nherds. If you leave these flocks unharmed, and think of nothing but\r\ngetting home, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you\r\nharm them, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship\r\nand of your comrades; and even though you may yourself escape, you will\r\nreturn late, in bad plight, after losing all your men.'", "\"Here she ended, and dawn enthroned in gold began to show in heaven,\r\nwhereon she returned inland. I then went on board and told my men to\r\nloose the ship from her moorings; so they at once got into her, took\r\ntheir places, and began to smite the grey sea with their oars. Presently\r\nthe great and cunning goddess Circe befriended us with a fair wind\r\nthat blew dead aft, and staid steadily with us, keeping our sails well\r\nfilled, so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship's gear, and let her\r\ngo as wind and helmsman headed her.", "\"Then, being much troubled in mind, I said to my men, 'My friends, it\r\nis not right that one or two of us alone should know the prophecies that\r\nCirce has made me, I will therefore tell you about them, so that whether\r\nwe live or die we may do so with our eyes open. First she said we were\r\nto keep clear of the Sirens, who sit and sing most beautifully in a\r\nfield of flowers; but she said I might hear them myself so long as no\r\none else did. Therefore, take me and bind me to the crosspiece half\r\nway up the mast; bind me as I stand upright, with a bond so fast that I\r\ncannot possibly break away, and lash the rope's ends to the mast itself.\r\nIf I beg and pray you to set me free, then bind me more tightly still.'", "\"I had hardly finished telling everything to the men before we\r\nreached the island of the two Sirens, {102} for the wind had been very\r\nfavourable. Then all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not a\r\nbreath of wind nor a ripple upon the water, so the men furled the sails\r\nand stowed them; then taking to their oars they whitened the water with\r\nthe foam they raised in rowing. Meanwhile I look a large wheel of wax\r\nand cut it up small with my sword. Then I kneaded the wax in my strong\r\nhands till it became soft, which it soon did between the kneading and\r\nthe rays of the sun-god son of Hyperion. Then I stopped the ears of all\r\nmy men, and they bound me hands and feet to the mast as I stood upright\r\non the cross piece; but they went on rowing themselves. When we had got\r\nwithin earshot of the land, and the ship was going at a good rate, the\r\nSirens saw that we were getting in shore and began with their singing.", "\"'Come here,' they sang, 'renowned Ulysses, honour to the Achaean name,\r\nand listen to our two voices. No one ever sailed past us without staying\r\nto hear the enchanting sweetness of our song--and he who listens will\r\ngo on his way not only charmed, but wiser, for we know all the ills that\r\nthe gods laid upon the Argives and Trojans before Troy, and can tell you\r\neverything that is going to happen over the whole world.'", "\"They sang these words most musically, and as I longed to hear them\r\nfurther I made signs by frowning to my men that they should set me free;\r\nbut they quickened their stroke, and Eurylochus and Perimedes bound me\r\nwith still stronger bonds till we had got out of hearing of the Sirens'\r\nvoices. Then my men took the wax from their ears and unbound me.", "\"Immediately after we had got past the island I saw a great wave from\r\nwhich spray was rising, and I heard a loud roaring sound. The men were\r\nso frightened that they loosed hold of their oars, for the whole sea\r\nresounded with the rushing of the waters, {103} but the ship stayed\r\nwhere it was, for the men had left off rowing. I went round, therefore,\r\nand exhorted them man by man not to lose heart.", "\"'My friends,' said I, 'this is not the first time that we have been\r\nin danger, and we are in nothing like so bad a case as when the Cyclops\r\nshut us up in his cave; nevertheless, my courage and wise counsel\r\nsaved us then, and we shall live to look back on all this as well. Now,\r\ntherefore, let us all do as I say, trust in Jove and row on with might\r\nand main. As for you, coxswain, these are your orders; attend to them,\r\nfor the ship is in your hands; turn her head away from these steaming\r\nrapids and hug the rock, or she will give you the slip and be over\r\nyonder before you know where you are, and you will be the death of us.'", "\"So they did as I told them; but I said nothing about the awful monster\r\nScylla, for I knew the men would not go on rowing if I did, but would\r\nhuddle together in the hold. In one thing only did I disobey Circe's\r\nstrict instructions--I put on my armour. Then seizing two strong spears\r\nI took my stand on the ship's bows, for it was there that I expected\r\nfirst to see the monster of the rock, who was to do my men so much harm;\r\nbut I could not make her out anywhere, though I strained my eyes with\r\nlooking the gloomy rock all over and over.", "\"Then we entered the Straits in great fear of mind, for on the one hand\r\nwas Scylla, and on the other dread Charybdis kept sucking up the salt\r\nwater. As she vomited it up, it was like the water in a cauldron when it\r\nis boiling over upon a great fire, and the spray reached the top of the\r\nrocks on either side. When she began to suck again, we could see the\r\nwater all inside whirling round and round, and it made a deafening sound\r\nas it broke against the rocks. We could see the bottom of the whirlpool\r\nall black with sand and mud, and the men were at their wits ends for\r\nfear. While we were taken up with this, and were expecting each moment\r\nto be our last, Scylla pounced down suddenly upon us and snatched up my\r\nsix best men. I was looking at once after both ship and men, and in a\r\nmoment I saw their hands and feet ever so high above me, struggling in\r\nthe air as Scylla was carrying them off, and I heard them call out my\r\nname in one last despairing cry. As a fisherman, seated, spear in hand,\r\nupon some jutting rock {104} throws bait into the water to deceive the\r\npoor little fishes, and spears them with the ox's horn with which his\r\nspear is shod, throwing them gasping on to the land as he catches them\r\none by one--even so did Scylla land these panting creatures on her\r\nrock and munch them up at the mouth of her den, while they screamed and\r\nstretched out their hands to me in their mortal agony. This was the most\r\nsickening sight that I saw throughout all my voyages.", "\"When we had passed the [Wandering] rocks, with Scylla and terrible\r\nCharybdis, we reached the noble island of the sun-god, where were the\r\ngoodly cattle and sheep belonging to the sun Hyperion. While still at\r\nsea in my ship I could bear the cattle lowing as they came home to the\r\nyards, and the sheep bleating. Then I remembered what the blind Theban\r\nprophet Teiresias had told me, and how carefully Aeaean Circe had warned\r\nme to shun the island of the blessed sun-god. So being much troubled I\r\nsaid to the men, 'My men, I know you are hard pressed, but listen while\r\nI tell you the prophecy that Teiresias made me, and how carefully Aeaean\r\nCirce warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god, for it\r\nwas here, she said, that our worst danger would lie. Head the ship,\r\ntherefore, away from the island.'", "\"The men were in despair at this, and Eurylochus at once gave me an\r\ninsolent answer. 'Ulysses,' said he, 'you are cruel; you are very strong\r\nyourself and never get worn out; you seem to be made of iron, and now,\r\nthough your men are exhausted with toil and want of sleep, you will not\r\nlet them land and cook themselves a good supper upon this island, but\r\nbid them put out to sea and go faring fruitlessly on through the watches\r\nof the flying night. It is by night that the winds blow hardest and do\r\nso much damage; how can we escape should one of those sudden squalls\r\nspring up from South West or West, which so often wreck a vessel when\r\nour lords the gods are unpropitious? Now, therefore, let us obey the\r\nbehests of night and prepare our supper here hard by the ship; to-morrow\r\nmorning we will go on board again and put out to sea.'", "\"Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. I saw that\r\nheaven meant us a mischief and said, 'You force me to yield, for you are\r\nmany against one, but at any rate each one of you must take his solemn\r\noath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep,\r\nhe will not be so mad as to kill a single head of either, but will be\r\nsatisfied with the food that Circe has given us.'", "\"They all swore as I bade them, and when they had completed their oath\r\nwe made the ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream of fresh\r\nwater, and the men went ashore and cooked their suppers. As soon as they\r\nhad had enough to eat and drink, they began talking about their poor\r\ncomrades whom Scylla had snatched up and eaten; this set them weeping\r\nand they went on crying till they fell off into a sound sleep.", "\"In the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their\r\nplaces, Jove raised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane so that\r\nland and sea were covered with thick clouds, and night sprang forth out\r\nof the heavens. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,\r\nwe brought the ship to land and drew her into a cave wherein the\r\nsea-nymphs hold their courts and dances, and I called the men together\r\nin council.", "\"'My friends,' said I, 'we have meat and drink in the ship, let us mind,\r\ntherefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for it; for\r\nthese cattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun, who sees and gives ear\r\nto everything.' And again they promised that they would obey.", "\"For a whole month the wind blew steadily from the South, and there was\r\nno other wind, but only South and East. {105} As long as corn and wine\r\nheld out the men did not touch the cattle when they were hungry; when,\r\nhowever, they had eaten all there was in the ship, they were forced\r\nto go further afield, with hook and line, catching birds, and taking\r\nwhatever they could lay their hands on; for they were starving. One day,\r\ntherefore, I went up inland that I might pray heaven to show me some\r\nmeans of getting away. When I had gone far enough to be clear of all\r\nmy men, and had found a place that was well sheltered from the wind,\r\nI washed my hands and prayed to all the gods in Olympus till by and by\r\nthey sent me off into a sweet sleep.", "\"Meanwhile Eurylochus had been giving evil counsel to the men, 'Listen\r\nto me,' said he, 'my poor comrades. All deaths are bad enough but there\r\nis none so bad as famine. Why should not we drive in the best of these\r\ncows and offer them in sacrifice to the immortal gods? If we ever get\r\nback to Ithaca, we can build a fine temple to the sun-god and enrich it\r\nwith every kind of ornament; if, however, he is determined to sink our\r\nship out of revenge for these homed cattle, and the other gods are of\r\nthe same mind, I for one would rather drink salt water once for all and\r\nhave done with it, than be starved to death by inches in such a desert\r\nisland as this is.'", "\"Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. Now the cattle,\r\nso fair and goodly, were feeding not far from the ship; the men,\r\ntherefore, drove in the best of them, and they all stood round them\r\nsaying their prayers, and using young oak-shoots instead of barley-meal,\r\nfor there was no barley left. When they had done praying they killed the\r\ncows and dressed their carcasses; they cut out the thigh bones, wrapped\r\nthem round in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on top\r\nof them. They had no wine with which to make drink-offerings over the\r\nsacrifice while it was cooking, so they kept pouring on a little water\r\nfrom time to time while the inward meats were being grilled; then, when\r\nthe thigh bones were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they\r\ncut the rest up small and put the pieces upon the spits.", "\"By this time my deep sleep had left me, and I turned back to the ship\r\nand to the sea shore. As I drew near I began to smell hot roast meat, so\r\nI groaned out a prayer to the immortal gods. 'Father Jove,' I exclaimed,\r\n'and all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss, you have done me\r\na cruel mischief by the sleep into which you have sent me; see what fine\r\nwork these men of mine have been making in my absence.'", "\"Meanwhile Lampetie went straight off to the sun and told him we had\r\nbeen killing his cows, whereon he flew into a great rage, and said\r\nto the immortals, 'Father Jove, and all you other gods who live in\r\neverlasting bliss, I must have vengeance on the crew of Ulysses' ship:\r\nthey have had the insolence to kill my cows, which were the one thing I\r\nloved to look upon, whether I was going up heaven or down again. If they\r\ndo not square accounts with me about my cows, I will go down to Hades\r\nand shine there among the dead.'", "\"'Sun,' said Jove, 'go on shining upon us gods and upon mankind over the\r\nfruitful earth. I will shiver their ship into little pieces with a bolt\r\nof white lightning as soon as they get out to sea.'", "\"I was told all this by Calypso, who said she had heard it from the\r\nmouth of Mercury.", "\"As soon as I got down to my ship and to the sea shore I rebuked each\r\none of the men separately, but we could see no way out of it, for the\r\ncows were dead already. And indeed the gods began at once to show signs\r\nand wonders among us, for the hides of the cattle crawled about, and\r\nthe joints upon the spits began to low like cows, and the meat, whether\r\ncooked or raw, kept on making a noise just as cows do.", "\"For six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting upon\r\nthem, but when Jove the son of Saturn had added a seventh day, the fury\r\nof the gale abated; we therefore went on board, raised our masts, spread\r\nsail, and put out to sea. As soon as we were well away from the island,\r\nand could see nothing but sky and sea, the son of Saturn raised a black\r\ncloud over our ship, and the sea grew dark beneath it. We did not get on\r\nmuch further, for in another moment we were caught by a terrific squall\r\nfrom the West that snapped the forestays of the mast so that it fell\r\naft, while all the ship's gear tumbled about at the bottom of the\r\nvessel. The mast fell upon the head of the helmsman in the ship's\r\nstern, so that the bones of his head were crushed to pieces, and he fell\r\noverboard as though he were diving, with no more life left in him.", "\"Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts, and the ship went round and\r\nround, and was filled with fire and brimstone as the lightning struck\r\nit. The men all fell into the sea; they were carried about in the water\r\nround the ship, looking like so many sea-gulls, but the god presently\r\ndeprived them of all chance of getting home again.", "\"I stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel (which\r\ndrifted about by itself) and struck the mast out of her in the direction\r\nof the keel; but there was a backstay of stout ox-thong still hanging\r\nabout it, and with this I lashed the mast and keel together, and getting\r\nastride of them was carried wherever the winds chose to take me.", "\"[The gale from the West had now spent its force, and the wind got into\r\nthe South again, which frightened me lest I should be taken back to the\r\nterrible whirlpool of Charybdis. This indeed was what actually happened,\r\nfor I was borne along by the waves all night, and by sunrise had reached\r\nthe rock of Scylla, and the whirlpool. She was then sucking down the\r\nsalt sea water, {106} but I was carried aloft toward the fig tree, which\r\nI caught hold of and clung on to like a bat. I could not plant my feet\r\nanywhere so as to stand securely, for the roots were a long way off and\r\nthe boughs that overshadowed the whole pool were too high, too vast, and\r\ntoo far apart for me to reach them; so I hung patiently on, waiting till\r\nthe pool should discharge my mast and raft again--and a very long while\r\nit seemed. A jury-man is not more glad to get home to supper, after\r\nhaving been long detained in court by troublesome cases, than I was to\r\nsee my raft beginning to work its way out of the whirlpool again. At\r\nlast I let go with my hands and feet, and fell heavily into the sea,\r\nhard by my raft on to which I then got, and began to row with my hands.\r\nAs for Scylla, the father of gods and men would not let her get further\r\nsight of me--otherwise I should have certainly been lost.] {107}", "%(dialogue)s", "\r\nBook XIII", "ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.", "Thus did he speak, and they all held their peace throughout the covered\r\ncloister, enthralled by the charm of his story, till presently Alcinous\r\nbegan to speak.", "%(dialogue)s said he, %(dialogue)s", "Every one approved of this, and then they went home to bed each in his\r\nown abode. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they\r\nhurried down to the ship and brought their cauldrons with them. Alcinous\r\nwent on board and saw everything so securely stowed under the ship's\r\nbenches that nothing could break adrift and injure the rowers. Then they\r\nwent to the house of Alcinous to get dinner, and he sacrificed a bull\r\nfor them in honour of Jove who is the lord of all. They set the steaks\r\nto grill and made an excellent dinner, after which the inspired bard,\r\nDemodocus, who was a favourite with every one, sang to them; but Ulysses\r\nkept on turning his eyes towards the sun, as though to hasten his\r\nsetting, for he was longing to be on his way. As one who has been all\r\nday ploughing a fallow field with a couple of oxen keeps thinking about\r\nhis supper and is glad when night comes that he may go and get it, for\r\nit is all his legs can do to carry him, even so did Ulysses rejoice when\r\nthe sun went down, and he at once said to the Phaeacians, addressing\r\nhimself more particularly to King Alcinous:", "%(dialogue)s", "Thus did he speak. His hearers all of them approved his saying and\r\nagreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken\r\nreasonably. Alcinous therefore said to his servant, %(dialogue)s", "Pontonous mixed the wine and handed it to every one in turn; the others\r\neach from his own seat made a drink-offering to the blessed gods that\r\nlive in heaven, but Ulysses rose and placed the double cup in the hands\r\nof queen Arete.", "%(dialogue)s said he, %(dialogue)s", "As he spoke he crossed the threshold, and Alcinous sent a man to conduct\r\nhim to his ship and to the sea shore. Arete also sent some maidservants\r\nwith him--one with a clean shirt and cloak, another to carry his strong\r\nbox, and a third with corn and wine. When they got to the water side\r\nthe crew took these things and put them on board, with all the meat and\r\ndrink; but for Ulysses they spread a rug and a linen sheet on deck that\r\nhe might sleep soundly in the stern of the ship. Then he too went on\r\nboard and lay down without a word, but the crew took every man his place\r\nand loosed the hawser from the pierced stone to which it had been bound.\r\nThereon, when they began rowing out to sea, Ulysses fell into a deep,\r\nsweet, and almost deathlike slumber. {111}", "The ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariot flies over\r\nthe course when the horses feel the whip. Her prow curvetted as it were\r\nthe neck of a stallion, and a great wave of dark blue water seethed in\r\nher wake. She held steadily on her course, and even a falcon, swiftest\r\nof all birds, could not have kept pace with her. Thus, then, she cut her\r\nway through the water, carrying one who was as cunning as the gods, but\r\nwho was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful of all that he had suffered\r\nboth on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea.", "When the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began to show,\r\nthe ship drew near to land. {112} Now there is in Ithaca a haven of the\r\nold merman Phorcys, which lies between two points that break the line\r\nof the sea and shut the harbour in. These shelter it from the storms of\r\nwind and sea that rage outside, so that, when once within it, a ship may\r\nlie without being even moored. At the head of this harbour there is a\r\nlarge olive tree, and at no great distance a fine overarching cavern\r\nsacred to the nymphs who are called Naiads. {113} There are mixing bowls\r\nwithin it and wine-jars of stone, and the bees hive there. Moreover,\r\nthere are great looms of stone on which the nymphs weave their robes of\r\nsea purple--very curious to see--and at all times there is water within\r\nit. It has two entrances, one facing North by which mortals can go\r\ndown into the cave, while the other comes from the South and is more\r\nmysterious; mortals cannot possibly get in by it, it is the way taken by\r\nthe gods.", "Into this harbour, then, they took their ship, for they knew the place.\r\n{114} She had so much way upon her that she ran half her own length on\r\nto the shore; {115} when, however, they had landed, the first thing they\r\ndid was to lift Ulysses with his rug and linen sheet out of the ship,\r\nand lay him down upon the sand still fast asleep. Then they took out the\r\npresents which Minerva had persuaded the Phaeacians to give him when he\r\nwas setting out on his voyage homewards. They put these all together by\r\nthe root of the olive tree, away from the road, for fear some passer by\r\n{116} might come and steal them before Ulysses awoke; and then they made\r\nthe best of their way home again.", "But Neptune did not forget the threats with which he had already\r\nthreatened Ulysses, so he took counsel with Jove. %(dialogue)s said\r\nhe, %(dialogue)s", "And Jove answered, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Neptune, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s answered Jove, %(dialogue)s", "When earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went to Scheria where the\r\nPhaeacians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making rapid\r\nway, had got close in.

He had been so long away that he did not\r\nknow it again; moreover, Jove's daughter Minerva had made it a foggy\r\nday, so that people might not know of his having come, and that she\r\nmight tell him everything without either his wife or his fellow citizens\r\nand friends recognising him {119} until he had taken his revenge upon\r\nthe wicked suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different to\r\nhim--the long straight tracks, the harbours, the precipices, and the\r\ngoodly trees, appeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his\r\nnative land.

Then Minerva came up to him\r\ndisguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien, with a good\r\ncloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandals on her comely\r\nfeet and held a javelin in her hand.

He found him sitting in front of his\r\nhut, which was by the yards that he had built on a site which could be\r\nseen from far. He had made them spacious {126} and fair to see, with\r\na free run for the pigs all round them; he had built them during his\r\nmaster's absence, of stones which he had gathered out of the ground,\r\nwithout saying anything to Penelope or Laertes, and he had fenced them\r\non top with thorn bushes. Outside the yard he had run a strong fence of\r\noaken posts, split, and set pretty close together, while inside he had\r\nbuilt twelve styes near one another for the sows to lie in. There were\r\nfifty pigs wallowing in each stye, all of them breeding sows; but the\r\nboars slept outside and were much fewer in number, for the suitors\r\nkept on eating them, and the swineherd had to send them the best he\r\nhad continually. There were three hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the\r\nherdsman's four hounds, which were as fierce as wolves, slept always\r\nwith them. The swineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of\r\nsandals {127} from a good stout ox hide.

When,\r\nhowever, death took him to the house of Hades, his sons divided his\r\nestate and cast lots for their shares, but to me they gave a holding\r\nand little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me to marry into a rich\r\nfamily, for I was not given to bragging, or shirking on the field of\r\nbattle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the straw you can see\r\nwhat the ear was, for I have had trouble enough and to spare. Mars and\r\nMinerva made me doughty in war; when I had picked my men to surprise the\r\nenemy with an ambuscade I never gave death so much as a thought, but was\r\nthe first to leap forward and spear all whom I could overtake. Such was\r\nI in battle, but I did not care about farm work, nor the frugal home\r\nlife of those who would bring up children. My delight was in ships,\r\nfighting, javelins, and arrows--things that most men shudder to think\r\nof; but one man likes one thing and another another, and this was what\r\nI was most naturally inclined to. Before the Achaeans went to Troy,\r\nnine times was I in command of men and ships on foreign service, and I\r\namassed much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil in the first instance,\r\nand much more was allotted to me later on.", "\"My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans,\r\nbut when Jove counselled that terrible expedition, in which so many\r\nperished, the people required me and Idomeneus to lead their ships to\r\nTroy, and there was no way out of it, for they insisted on our doing\r\nso. There we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth we sacked the\r\ncity of Priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us. Then it was\r\nthat Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one month happily with my\r\nchildren, wife, and property, and then I conceived the idea of making a\r\ndescent on Egypt, so I fitted out a fine fleet and manned it. I had nine\r\nships, and the people flocked to fill them. For six days I and my men\r\nmade feast, and I found them many victims both for sacrifice to the gods\r\nand for themselves, but on the seventh day we went on board and set sail\r\nfrom Crete with a fair North wind behind us though we were going down a\r\nriver. Nothing went ill with any of our ships, and we had no sickness\r\non board, but sat where we were and let the ships go as the wind and\r\nsteersmen took them.

The Egyptians killed many\r\nof us, and took the rest alive to do forced labour for them. Jove,\r\nhowever, put it in my mind to do thus--and I wish I had died then and\r\nthere in Egypt instead, for there was much sorrow in store for me--I\r\ntook off my helmet and shield and dropped my spear from my hand; then\r\nI went straight up to the king's chariot, clasped his knees and kissed\r\nthem, whereon he spared my life, bade me get into his chariot, and took\r\nme weeping to his own home. Many made at me with their ashen spears and\r\ntried to kill me in their fury, but the king protected me, for he feared\r\nthe wrath of Jove the protector of strangers, who punishes those who do\r\nevil.", "\"I stayed there for seven years and got together much money among the\r\nEgyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now going on\r\nfor eight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning rascal, who\r\nhad already committed all sorts of villainy, and this man talked me over\r\ninto going with him to Phoenicia, where his house and his possessions\r\nlay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months, but at the end of that\r\ntime when months and days had gone by till the same season had come\r\nround again, he set me on board a ship bound for Libya, on a pretence\r\nthat I was to take a cargo along with him to that place, but really that\r\nhe might sell me as a slave and take the money I fetched.

Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts and\r\nthe ship went round and round and was filled with fire and brimstone\r\nas the lightning struck it. The men fell all into the sea; they\r\nwere carried about in the water round the ship looking like so many\r\nsea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of getting\r\nhome again. I was all dismayed. Jove, however, sent the ship's mast\r\nwithin my reach, which saved my life, for I clung to it, and drifted\r\nbefore the fury of the gale. Nine days did I drift but in the darkness\r\nof the tenth night a great wave bore me on to the Thesprotian coast.\r\nThere Pheidon king of the Thesprotians entertained me hospitably without\r\ncharging me anything at all--for his son found me when I was nearly dead\r\nwith cold and fatigue, whereon he raised me by the hand, took me to his\r\nfather's house and gave me clothes to wear.", "\"There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me he\r\nhad entertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on his\r\nhomeward journey.

There was enough to keep his family\r\nfor ten generations, so much had he left in the house of king Pheidon.\r\nBut the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that he might learn Jove's\r\nmind from the god's high oak tree, and know whether after so long an\r\nabsence he should return to Ithaca openly, or in secret. Moreover the\r\nking swore in my presence, making drink-offerings in his own house as\r\nhe did so, that the ship was by the water side, and the crew found,\r\nthat should take him to his own country. He sent me off however before\r\nUlysses returned, for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing\r\nfor the wheat-growing island of Dulichium, and he told those in charge\r\nof her to be sure and take me safely to King Acastus.", "%(dialogue)s", "To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Poor unhappy stranger, I\r\nhave found the story of your misfortunes extremely interesting, but that\r\npart about Ulysses is not right; and you will never get me to believe\r\nit.

The gods one and all of them detest\r\nhim, or they would have taken him before Troy, or let him die with\r\nfriends around him when the days of his fighting were done; for then the\r\nAchaeans would have built a mound over his ashes and his son would have\r\nbeen heir to his renown, but now the storm winds have spirited him away\r\nwe know not whither.", "%(dialogue)s", "Ulysses answered, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s replied Eumaeus, %(dialogue)s", "Thus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with\r\nthe pigs, which were then shut up for the night in their styes, and a\r\ntremendous squealing they made as they were being driven into them. But\r\nEumaeus called to his men and said, %(dialogue)s", "On this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a fine\r\nfat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar.

Then he clubbed the pig with a billet of oak which he had\r\nkept back when he was chopping the firewood, and stunned it, while the\r\nothers slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it up, and Eumaeus began\r\nby putting raw pieces from each joint on to some of the fat; these he\r\nsprinkled with barley meal, and laid upon the embers; they cut the rest\r\nof the meat up small, put the pieces upon the spits and roasted them\r\ntill they were done; when they had taken them off the spits they\r\nthrew them on to the dresser in a heap. The swineherd, who was a most\r\nequitable man, then stood up to give every one his share. He made seven\r\nportions; one of these he set apart for Mercury the son of Maia and the\r\nnymphs, praying to them as he did so; the others he dealt out to the men\r\nman by man. He gave Ulysses some slices cut lengthways down the loin\r\nas a mark of especial honour, and Ulysses was much pleased. %(dialogue)s said he, %(dialogue)s", "To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, %(dialogue)s", "As he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt\r\nsacrifice to the immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering,\r\nput the cup in the hands of Ulysses, and sat down to his own portion.\r\nMesaulius brought them their bread; the swineherd had brought this man\r\non his own account from among the Taphians during his master's absence,\r\nand had paid for him with his own money without saying anything either\r\nto his mistress or Laertes. They then laid their hands upon the good\r\nthings that were before them, and when they had had enough to eat and\r\ndrink, Mesaulius took away what was left of the bread, and they all went\r\nto bed after having made a hearty supper.", "Now the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon. It\r\npoured without ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West, which is\r\na wet quarter, so Ulysses thought he would see whether Eumaeus, in the\r\nexcellent care he took of him, would take off his own cloak and give\r\nit him, or make one of his men give him one. %(dialogue)s said he,\r\n\"Eumaeus and the rest of you; when I have said a prayer I will tell you\r\nsomething.

Would that I were still young and strong as when we\r\ngot up an ambuscade before Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses were the leaders,\r\nbut I was in command also, for the other two would have it so.

The others had all got cloaks and shirts, and slept\r\ncomfortably enough with their shields about their shoulders, but I had\r\ncarelessly left my cloak behind me, not thinking that I should be too\r\ncold, and had gone off in nothing but my shirt and shield. When the\r\nnight was two-thirds through and the stars had shifted their places, I\r\nnudged Ulysses who was close to me with my elbow, and he at once gave me\r\nhis ear.", "\"'Ulysses,' said I, 'this cold will be the death of me, for I have no\r\ncloak; some god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but my shirt,\r\nand I do not know what to do.'", "\"Ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following\r\nplan:", "\"'Keep still,' said he in a low voice, 'or the others will hear you.'\r\nThen he raised his head on his elbow.", "\"'My friends,' said he, 'I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep.

Ulysses was the first to raise his spear\r\nand try to drive it into the brute, but the boar was too quick for him,\r\nand charged him sideways, ripping him above the knee with a gash that\r\ntore deep though it did not reach the bone. As for the boar, Ulysses hit\r\nhim on the right shoulder, and the point of the spear went right through\r\nhim, so that he fell groaning in the dust until the life went out of\r\nhim. The sons of Autolycus busied themselves with the carcass of the\r\nboar, and bound Ulysses' wound; then, after saying a spell to stop the\r\nbleeding, they went home as fast as they could. But when Autolycus and\r\nhis sons had thoroughly healed Ulysses, they made him some splendid\r\npresents, and sent him back to Ithaca with much mutual good will. When\r\nhe got back, his father and mother were rejoiced to see him, and asked\r\nhim all about it, and how he had hurt himself to get the scar; so he\r\ntold them how the boar had ripped him when he was out hunting with\r\nAutolycus and his sons on Mt.

The two fell in with one another\r\nin Messene at the house of Ortilochus, where Ulysses was staying in\r\norder to recover a debt that was owing from the whole people; for the\r\nMessenians had carried off three hundred sheep from Ithaca, and had\r\nsailed away with them and with their shepherds. In quest of these\r\nUlysses took a long journey while still quite young, for his father and\r\nthe other chieftains sent him on a mission to recover them. Iphitus had\r\ngone there also to try and get back twelve brood mares that he had lost,\r\nand the mule foals that were running with them. These mares were the\r\ndeath of him in the end, for when he went to the house of Jove's son,\r\nmighty Hercules, who performed such prodigies of valour, Hercules to his\r\nshame killed him, though he was his guest, for he feared not heaven's\r\nvengeance, nor yet respected his own table which he had set before\r\nIphitus, but killed him in spite of everything, and kept the mares\r\nhimself. It was when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and gave\r\nhim the bow which mighty Eurytus had been used to carry, and which on\r\nhis death had been left by him to his son. Ulysses gave him in return\r\na sword and a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast friendship,\r\nalthough they never visited at one another's houses, for Jove's son\r\nHercules killed Iphitus ere they could do so. This bow, then, given him\r\nby Iphitus, had not been taken with him by Ulysses when he sailed for\r\nTroy; he had used it so long as he had been at home, but had left it\r\nbehind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.", "Penelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store-room; the\r\ncarpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as to get\r\nit quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and hung the\r\ndoors.

She sat down with it on her knees, weeping bitterly as\r\nshe took the bow out of its case, and when her tears had relieved her,\r\nshe went to the cloister where the suitors were, carrying the bow and\r\nthe quiver, with the many deadly arrows that were inside it. Along\r\nwith her came her maidens, bearing a chest that contained much iron\r\nand bronze which her husband had won as prizes.

Then Telemachus sprang away from\r\nhim, leaving his spear still in the body, for he feared that if he\r\nstayed to draw it out, some one of the Achaeans might come up and hack\r\nat him with his sword, or knock him down, so he set off at a run, and\r\nimmediately was at his father's side. Then he said:", "%(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s answered Ulysses, %(dialogue)s", "Telemachus did as his father said, and went off to the store room where\r\nthe armour was kept.

He brought them with all speed to his\r\nfather, and armed himself first, while the stockman and the swineherd\r\nalso put on their armour, and took their places near Ulysses. Meanwhile\r\nUlysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been shooting the suitors one\r\nby one, and they fell thick on one another: when his arrows gave out, he\r\nset the bow to stand against the end wall of the house by the door post,\r\nand hung a shield four hides thick about his shoulders; on his comely\r\nhead he set his helmet, well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that\r\nnodded menacingly above it, {168} and he grasped two redoubtable\r\nbronze-shod spears.", "Now there was a trap door {169} on the wall, while at one end of the\r\npavement {170} there was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and this\r\nexit was closed by a well-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius to stand by\r\nthis door and guard it, for only one person could attack it at a time.\r\nBut Agelaus shouted out, %(dialogue)s", "%(dialogue)s answered Melanthius, %(dialogue)s", "On this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages to the store-room\r\nof Ulysses' house.

Ulysses' heart began to fail him when he saw the suitors\r\n{171} putting on their armour and brandishing their spears. He saw the\r\ngreatness of the danger, and said to Telemachus, %(dialogue)s", "Telemachus answered, %(dialogue)s", "Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going to the\r\nstore room to fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him and said to\r\nUlysses who was beside him, %(dialogue)s", "Ulysses answered, %(dialogue)s", "Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went to the\r\nstore room, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, for he was\r\nbusy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room, so the\r\ntwo took their stand on either side of the door and waited. By and by\r\nMelanthius came out with a helmet in one hand, and an old dry-rotted\r\nshield in the other, which had been borne by Laertes when he was young,\r\nbut which had been long since thrown aside, and the straps had become\r\nunsewn; on this the two seized him, dragged him back by the hair, and\r\nthrew him struggling to the ground. They bent his hands and feet well\r\nbehind his back, and bound them tight with a painful bond as Ulysses had\r\ntold them; then they fastened a noose about his body and strung him up\r\nfrom a high pillar till he was close up to the rafters, and over him did\r\nyou then vaunt, O swineherd Eumaeus saying, %(dialogue)s", "There, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put on\r\ntheir armour they closed the door behind them and went back to take\r\ntheir places by the side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in the\r\ncloister, fierce and full of fury; nevertheless, those who were in the\r\nbody of the court were still both brave and many. Then Jove's daughter\r\nMinerva came up to them, having assumed the voice and form of Mentor.\r\nUlysses was glad when he saw her and said, %(dialogue)s", "But all the time he felt sure it was Minerva, and the suitors from the\r\nother side raised an uproar when they saw her. Agelaus was the first to\r\nreproach her. %(dialogue)s he cried, %(dialogue)s", "This made Minerva still more furious, so she scolded Ulysses very\r\nangrily. {173} %(dialogue)s said she, %(dialogue)s", "But she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished still\r\nfurther to prove his own prowess and that of his brave son, so she flew\r\nup to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat upon it in\r\nthe form of a swallow.", "Meanwhile Agelaus son of Damastor, Eurynomus, Amphimedon, Demoptolemus,\r\nPisander, and Polybus son of Polyctor bore the brunt of the fight upon\r\nthe suitors' side; of all those who were still fighting for their lives\r\nthey were by far the most valiant, for the others had already fallen\r\nunder the arrows of Ulysses. Agelaus shouted to them and said, %(dialogue)s", "They threw their spears as he bade them, but Minerva made them all of\r\nno effect. One hit the door post; another went against the door; the\r\npointed shaft of another struck the wall; and as soon as they had\r\navoided all the spears of the suitors Ulysses said to his own men, %(dialogue)s", "They therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears.\r\nUlysses killed Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, Eumaeus Elatus, while\r\nthe stockman killed Pisander. These all bit the dust, and as the others\r\ndrew back into a corner Ulysses and his men rushed forward and regained\r\ntheir spears by drawing them from the bodies of the dead.", "The suitors now aimed a second time, but again Minerva made their\r\nweapons for the most part without effect. One hit a bearing-post of\r\nthe cloister; another went against the door; while the pointed shaft of\r\nanother struck the wall. Still, Amphimedon just took a piece of the\r\ntop skin from off Telemachus's wrist, and Ctesippus managed to graze\r\nEumaeus's shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and fell\r\nto the ground. Then Ulysses and his men let drive into the crowd of\r\nsuitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and Eumaeus\r\nPolybus. After this the stockman hit Ctesippus in the breast, and\r\ntaunted him saying, %(dialogue)s", "Thus spoke the stockman, and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor with a\r\nspear in close fight, while Telemachus hit Leocritus son of Evenor in\r\nthe belly, and the dart went clean through him, so that he fell forward\r\nfull on his face upon the ground. Then Minerva from her seat on the\r\nrafter held up her deadly aegis, and the hearts of the suitors quailed.\r\nThey fled to the other end of the court like a herd of cattle maddened\r\nby the gadfly in early summer when the days are at their longest. As\r\neagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from the mountains swoop down on\r\nthe smaller birds that cower in flocks upon the ground, and kill\r\nthem, for they cannot either fight or fly, and lookers on enjoy the\r\nsport--even so did Ulysses and his men fall upon the suitors and smite\r\nthem on every side. They made a horrible groaning as their brains were\r\nbeing battered in, and the ground seethed with their blood.", "Leiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said, %(dialogue)s", "Ulysses looked sternly at him and answered, %(dialogue)s", "With these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had dropped when\r\nhe was being killed, and which was lying upon the ground. Then he struck\r\nLeiodes on the back of his neck, so that his head fell rolling in the\r\ndust while he was yet speaking.", "The minstrel Phemius son of Terpes--he who had been forced by the\r\nsuitors to sing to them--now tried to save his life. He was standing\r\nnear towards the trap door, {174} and held his lyre in his hand. He did\r\nnot know whether to fly out of the cloister and sit down by the altar of\r\nJove that was in the outer court, and on which both Laertes and Ulysses\r\nhad offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or whether to go straight\r\nup to Ulysses and embrace his knees, but in the end he deemed it best\r\nto embrace Ulysses' knees. So he laid his lyre on the ground between the\r\nmixing bowl {175} and the silver-studded seat; then going up to Ulysses\r\nhe caught hold of his knees and said, %(dialogue)s", "Telemachus heard him, and at once went up to his father. %(dialogue)s he\r\ncried, %(dialogue)s", "Medon caught these words of Telemachus, for he was crouching under a\r\nseat beneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly\r\nflayed heifer's hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to Telemachus,\r\nand laid hold of his knees.", "%(dialogue)s said he, %(dialogue)s", "Ulysses smiled at him and answered, %(dialogue)s", "The pair went into the outer court as fast as they could, and sat down\r\nby Jove's great altar, looking fearfully round, and still expecting that\r\nthey would be killed. Then Ulysses searched the whole court carefully\r\nover, to see if anyone had managed to hide himself and was still living,\r\nbut he found them all lying in the dust and weltering in their blood.\r\nThey were like fishes which fishermen have netted out of the sea, and\r\nthrown upon the beach to lie gasping for water till the heat of the sun\r\nmakes an end of them.

When they had\r\ndone this, they cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges and water,\r\nwhile Telemachus and the two others shovelled up the blood and dirt from\r\nthe ground, and the women carried it all away and put it out of doors.\r\nThen when they had made the whole place quite clean and orderly, they\r\ntook the women out and hemmed them in the narrow space between the wall\r\nof the domed room and that of the yard, so that they could not get away:\r\nand Telemachus said to the other two, %(dialogue)s", "So saying he made a ship's cable fast to one of the bearing-posts that\r\nsupported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around the\r\nbuilding, at a good height, lest any of the women's feet should touch\r\nthe ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that has been\r\nset for them in a thicket just as they were getting to their nest, and a\r\nterrible fate awaits them, even so did the women have to put their heads\r\nin nooses one after the other and die most miserably. {178} Their feet\r\nmoved convulsively for a while, but not for very long.", "As for Melanthius, they took him through the cloister into the inner\r\ncourt.

Days and nights\r\nseven and ten we mourned you, mortals and immortals, but on the\r\neighteenth day we gave you to the flames, and many a fat sheep with many\r\nan ox did we slay in sacrifice around you.

The Odyssean line reads, [Greek]. The\r\nfamous dactylism, therefore, of the Odyssean line was probably suggested\r\nby that of the Ileadic rather than by a desire to accommodate sound to\r\nsense.

I have\r\ntherefore with some diffidence ventured to depart from the received\r\ntranslation of [Greek] (cf. Alcaeus frag. 18, where, however, it is\r\nvery hard to say what [Greek] means). In Sophocles' Lexicon I find a\r\nreference to Chrysostom (l, 242, A. Ed.

When\r\nUlysses comes to take the route prescribed by Circe, he ought to pass\r\neither the Wanderers or some other difficulty of which we are not told,\r\nbut he does not do so. The Planctae, or Wanderers, merge into Scylla and\r\nCharybdis, and the alternative between them and something untold\r\nmerges into the alternative whether Ulysses had better choose Scylla or\r\nCharybdis. Yet from line 260, it seems we are to consider the Wanderers\r\nas having been passed by Ulysses; this appears even more plainly from\r\nxxiii. 327, in which Ulysses expressly mentions the Wandering rocks as\r\nhaving been between the Sirens and Scylla and Charybdis. The writer,\r\nhowever, is evidently unaware that she does not quite understand her own\r\nstory; her difficulty was perhaps due to the fact that though Trapanese\r\nsailors had given her a fair idea as to where all her other localities\r\nreally were, no one in those days more than in our own could localise\r\nthe Planctae, which in fact, as Buttmann has argued, were derived not\r\nfrom any particular spot, but from sailors' tales about the difficulties\r\nof navigating the group of the Aeolian islands as a whole (see note on\r\n%(dialogue)s x. 3). Still the matter of the poor doves caught her fancy, so she\r\nwould not forgo them. The whirlwinds of fire and the smoke that hangs on\r\nScylla suggests allusion to Stromboli and perhaps even Etna. Scylla is\r\non the Italian side, and therefore may be said to look West. It is about\r\n8 miles thence to the Sicilian coast, so Ulysses may be perfectly well\r\ntold that after passing Scylla he will come to the Thrinacian island or\r\nSicily. Charybdis is transposed to a site some few miles to the north of\r\nits actual position.", "{101} I suppose this line to have been intercalated by the author when\r\nlines 426-446 were added.", "{102} For the reasons which enable us to identify the island of the two\r\nSirens with the Lipari island now Salinas--the ancient Didyme, or %(dialogue)s\r\nisland--see The Authoress of the Odyssey, pp. 195, 196.

Besides, the aorist [Greek]\r\nin its present surrounding is perplexing. I have translated it as though\r\nit were an imperfect; I see Messrs.

She probably\r\noriginally meant to call her Euryclea, but finding it not immediately\r\neasy to make Euryclea scan in xvii. 495, she hastily called her\r\nEurynome, intending either to alter this name later or to change the\r\nearlier Euryclea's into Eurynome. She then drifted in to Eurynome\r\nas convenience further directed, still nevertheless hankering after\r\nEuryclea, till at last she found that the path of least resistance\r\nwould lie in the direction of making Eurynome and Euryclea two persons.\r\nTherefore in xxiii. 289-292 both Eurynome and %(dialogue)s (who can be\r\nnone other than Euryclea) come on together.

From the\r\ntop of the tower the outer world was to be told what was going on, but\r\npeople could not get in by the [Greek]: they would have to come in by\r\nthe main entrance, and Melanthius explains that the mouth of the narrow\r\npassage (which was in the lands of Ulysses and his friends) commanded\r\nthe only entrance by which help could come, so that there would be\r\nnothing gained by raising an alarm. As for the [Greek] of line 143,\r\nno commentator ancient or modern has been able to say what was\r\nintended--but whatever they were, Melanthius could never carry twelve\r\nshields, twelve helmets, and twelve spears.
